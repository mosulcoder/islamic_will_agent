---

## PHASE 1 — Before the Signing Appointment

### Legal Review
- [ ] Share the drafted will with a **Tennessee-licensed estate planning attorney** for review
- [ ] Confirm the attorney is familiar with (or open to) faith-based estate planning
- [ ] Address any attorney feedback before scheduling the signing

### Document Preparation
- [ ] Print the **Last Will and Testament** on standard white paper (no colored paper)
- [ ] Print the **Waiver of Elective Share** (if married) as a separate document
- [ ] Print the **Self-Proving Affidavit** (attached to the will)
- [ ] Prepare the **Beneficiary Designation action list** (non-probate assets)
- [ ] Verify all names in the will match exactly with legal identification documents

### Identify Disinterested Witnesses
Two witnesses are required. They must be:
- [ ] Adults (18 years or older)
- [ ] **NOT named as a beneficiary** in this will (disinterested)
- [ ] **NOT married to a beneficiary** in this will
- [ ] Present and able to observe the testator signing
- [ ] Willing to sign in front of a Notary Public

*Good choices: Masjid members, neighbors, coworkers, friends who are not heirs*

### Notary Public
- [ ] Locate a Notary Public (banks, UPS Store, law offices, Tennessee Secretary of State offices often have notaries)
- [ ] Confirm the Notary can notarize a self-proving will affidavit
- [ ] Schedule the appointment with both witnesses and the Notary present simultaneously

## PHASE 2 — The Signing Appointment

### Testator Requirements
- [ ] Bring **government-issued photo ID** (driver's license or passport)
- [ ] Be of **sound mind and memory** on the day of signing
- [ ] Sign the will **in the presence of both witnesses and the Notary**
- [ ] Initial every page of the will (recommended best practice)

### Witness Requirements
- [ ] Both witnesses **watch the testator sign**
- [ ] Both witnesses sign **in the testator's presence** and **in each other's presence**
- [ ] Each witness prints their full name and current address

### Notary Requirements
- [ ] Notary administers the **Self-Proving Affidavit oath** to the testator and both witnesses
- [ ] Testator and both witnesses sign the affidavit **in front of the Notary**
- [ ] Notary affixes **official seal** and signs with commission expiration date

### If Married — Spouse Waiver Signing
- [ ] Spouse signs the **Waiver of Elective Share** before the Notary
- [ ] Spouse had opportunity to review with independent legal counsel (document this)
- [ ] Notary administers acknowledgment for the waiver
- [ ] Waiver is signed as a **separate document** from the will (stored together)

---

## PHASE 3 — After the Signing Appointment

### Document Storage
- [ ] **Original signed will:** Store in a fireproof safe, safe deposit box, or with your attorney
- [ ] **DO NOT store the original in a safe deposit box that requires probate to open** — this creates a circular problem in Tennessee
- [ ] Keep **one certified copy** at home in a known location
- [ ] Give a copy (not the original) to your Executor
- [ ] Tell your Executor and trusted family member exactly where the original is stored
- [ ] Consider filing an **informal will registration** with the Tennessee Register of Wills (optional but helpful)

### Update Non-Probate Assets (CRITICAL — These Do Not Pass Through the Will)
Complete within 30 days of signing the will:

**Life Insurance:**
- [ ] Contact each life insurance company
- [ ] Update primary and contingent beneficiary designations
- [ ] Confirm designations match Islamic inheritance shares

**Retirement Accounts (401k, 403b, IRA, Pension):**
- [ ] Contact each plan administrator or HR department
- [ ] Update primary and contingent beneficiary designations
- [ ] Consider naming an Islamic Estate Trust as beneficiary for large accounts to enable Fara'id distribution

**Bank Accounts (POD — Payable on Death):**
- [ ] Visit each bank in person or complete online
- [ ] Update Payable-on-Death (POD) designations

**Investment Accounts (TOD — Transfer on Death):**
- [ ] Contact each brokerage
- [ ] Update Transfer-on-Death (TOD) designations

**Real Estate (Joint Tenancy):**
- [ ] Review how all real property is titled (warranty deed)
- [ ] If titled as "Joint Tenants with Right of Survivorship," the surviving owner inherits automatically — this overrides the will
- [ ] Consult an attorney about re-titling as "Tenants in Common" if this conflicts with your Islamic plan

---

## PHASE 4 — Ongoing Maintenance

### Review Triggers — Re-Execute the Will After Any of These Events:
- [ ] Marriage (Tennessee law auto-revokes prior will upon remarriage — T.C.A. § 32-1-201)
- [ ] Divorce (provisions for ex-spouse auto-revoked — T.C.A. § 32-1-202)
- [ ] Birth or legal adoption of a child
- [ ] Death of an heir named in the will
- [ ] Death of your appointed Executor or Guardian
- [ ] Significant increase or decrease in estate value (more than 25%)
- [ ] Acquisition of real estate in another state
- [ ] Moving out of Tennessee (will remains valid but new state requirements may differ)
- [ ] Change in Madhhab or significant change in Islamic legal opinion followed

### Routine Review
- [ ] Review the will and all beneficiary designations every **3–5 years**
- [ ] Confirm the Executor and Guardian are still willing and able to serve
