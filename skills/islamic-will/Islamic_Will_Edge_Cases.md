# Edge Cases & Modern Family Dynamics (Sunni Fiqh)

#### 1. Adopted Children (*Tabanni*)

* **Ruling:** Islamic law does not recognize legal adoption as establishing a blood lineage (*Nasab*). Therefore, legally adopted children **do not** qualify as Quranic Heirs (*Mirath*) and cannot receive fixed shares.
* **The Solution:** The testator can (and is encouraged to) provide for adopted children using the **Wasiyyah** (voluntary bequest), giving them up to **1/3** of the total net estate.

#### 2. Step-Children & Step-Parents

* **Ruling:** There is no blood relationship. Step-children do not inherit from step-parents, and step-parents do not inherit from step-children via fixed shares.
* **The Solution:** Like adopted children, they can only receive property through the **1/3 Wasiyyah**.

#### 3. Unborn Fetus (*Al-Haml*)

* **Ruling:** A fetus has a right to inherit, provided it is born alive (even if it dies shortly after birth).
* **Distribution Mechanics:** The estate distribution is paused or partially distributed by reserving the maximum possible share for the fetus until birth.
* **Hanafi School:** Reserves the share of either **one son or one daughter** (whichever takes the larger portion).
* **Shafi'i School:** More conservative; reserves the share of **two sons or two females** (whichever takes the maximum portion) to avoid under-allocating. Once born, the actual share is given, and any surplus is returned to the other heirs.



#### 4. Simultaneous Death (*Al-Gharqa / Al-Hadma*)

* **Scenario:** Two relatives who would inherit from each other (e.g., Husband and Wife) die in the same event (e.g., a car crash in Tennessee), and it cannot be medically proven who died first.
* **Ruling:** Neither inherits from the other. The husband’s estate is distributed directly to his surviving heirs as if the wife died before him, and the wife’s estate is distributed to her surviving heirs as if the husband died before her.

#### 5. Children Born Outside of Marriage (*Walad al-Zina*)

* **Ruling:** Under traditional Sunni law, a child born out of wedlock does not establish legal lineage (*Nasab*) with the biological father.
* **Distribution:**
* They **do not** inherit from the biological father or his relatives.
* They **do** inherit normally from the mother and the mother's relatives.



#### 6. The Missing Person (*Al-Mafqud*)

* **Scenario:** An heir has disappeared, and it is unknown if they are alive or dead.
* **Ruling:** * Regarding their *own* wealth: It cannot be distributed until a judge officially declares them dead.
* Regarding *inheriting* from others: They are treated as alive. Their share is reserved from the estate until their status is confirmed or a judge declares them legally dead (at which point the reserved share is redistributed to the other heirs).



#### 7. Non-Muslim Relatives

* **Ruling:** As covered in the core principles, difference of religion is an impediment to *Mirath*. A Muslim cannot inherit from a non-Muslim, and a non-Muslim cannot inherit from a Muslim via fixed Shariah shares.
* **The Solution:** A Muslim is legally permitted to leave up to **1/3 of their estate** to a non-Muslim relative (e.g., a non-Muslim parent or sibling) via the **Wasiyyah**.
