# Madhhab Comparison: Inheritance Rulings (Hanafi vs. Shafi'i)

## Integration Step

This document serves as the "Rulebook" for the AI Agent. When a user presents a complex case (like a Grandfather and Brothers), the agent will now look at this file to differentiate its answer based on the user's selected Mathhab.


## 1. The Residue (Ar-Radd)

* **Hanafi Position:** If the fixed Quranic shares (*Zawil Furood*) do not total 100% and there are no residuaries (*Asaba*), the surplus is returned to the Quranic heirs in proportion to their shares. Note: The spouse is traditionally excluded from *Radd* unless no other heirs exist.
* **Shafi'i Position:** Traditionally, the residue was sent to the *Bayt al-Mal* (Public Treasury). However, in modern application (where a functional/trustworthy Treasury is absent), the Shafi'i school follows the "Modern Fatwa" which allows *Radd* back to the heirs, similar to the Hanafi position, to keep wealth within the family.

## 2. The True Grandfather (Paternal)

* **Hanafi Position:** The Paternal Grandfather is treated exactly like the Father in the Father's absence. Crucially, Abu Hanifa ruled that the Grandfather **totally excludes** all brothers and sisters (full or paternal).
* **Shafi'i Position:** The Grandfather does **not** automatically exclude brothers and sisters. Instead, they share the inheritance. The Shafi'i school uses complex "Muqasama" (sharing) rules to ensure the Grandfather receives the best possible share (the greater of 1/3 of the residue or sharing as a male sibling).

## 3. Distant Kindred (Zawil Arham)

* **Hanafi Position:** If there are no Quranic heirs and no *Asaba*, the estate goes to "Distant Kindred" (e.g., daughter’s children, sisters’ children, maternal aunts/uncles). They have a ranked order of entitlement.
* **Shafi'i Position:** Historically, Distant Kindred did not inherit; the estate went to the *Bayt al-Mal*. In contemporary Shafi'i practice, they may inherit via the same "Modern Fatwa" logic used for *Radd* if no other heirs exist.

## 4. The Case of Al-Mushtaraka (The Shared Case)

* *Scenario: Husband, Mother (or Grandmother), two or more Uterine Brothers, and at least one Full Brother.*
* **Hanafi Position:** The Full Brother receives nothing because the fixed shares (1/2 for husband, 1/6 for mother, 1/3 for uterine brothers) exhaust the estate. The Full Brother is a residuary (*Asaba*) and there is no residue left.
* **Shafi'i Position:** The Full Brother is allowed to **share** the 1/3 share with the Uterine Brothers. The logic is that they all share the same mother, so the Full Brother should not be penalized for having a "stronger" link (the same father).

## 5. Accidental Homicide

* **Hanafi Position:** A killer is barred from inheriting if the killing was "unlawful" and "direct." However, accidental killing via an "indirect cause" (like digging a well that someone falls into) might not bar the heir in specific sub-rulings.
* **Shafi'i Position:** The bar is absolute. Any type of killing (intentional, accidental, or indirect) prevents the killer from inheriting from the victim.

## 6. Fetus/Unborn Child

* **Hanafi Position:** The estate is distributed assuming the most "advantageous" outcome for the fetus (usually assuming the birth of one son or one daughter) and the shares are reserved until birth.
* **Shafi'i Position:** The distribution is more cautious. The estate is distributed as if the fetus is **either** two males or two females, reserving the maximum possible share to avoid under-allocating, which freezes more of the estate until the birth.

## 7. Aul (Pro-rata Reduction)

* **Both Schools:** Both the Hanafi and Shafi'i schools agree on the application of *Al-Aul*. If the fixed shares exceed 1.0 (e.g., 15/12), the denominator is increased to the sum of the numerators (making it 15/15), effectively reducing every heir's share proportionally.
