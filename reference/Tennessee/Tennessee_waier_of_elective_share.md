In Tennessee, a **Waiver of Elective Share** is a legal document used to prevent state law from overriding the specific distribution you’ve set in your Islamic will.

Here is the breakdown of why it is essential for an Islamically compliant will in the U.S.:

### 1. The Conflict: Tennessee Law vs. Shariah

Under **Tennessee Code § 31-4-101**, a surviving spouse has a legal right to "elect" against a will. This means even if your will says your spouse gets , they can go to court and demand a legal minimum (the "Elective Share") based on how long you were married:

* **Married < 3 years:** 10% of the estate.
* **Married 3–6 years:** 20%.
* **Married 6–9 years:** 30%.
* **Married 9+ years:** 40%.

**The Problem:** In Shariah, a wife’s share is fixed at either **1/8 (12.5%)** if there are children or **1/4 (25%)** if there are not. If you have been married for 10 years, Tennessee law says she is entitled to **40%**, which significantly exceeds the Islamic share and takes money away from other Quranic heirs (like parents or children).

### 2. The Purpose of the Waiver

The waiver is a signed agreement where the spouse voluntarily gives up their right to claim that 10%–40% Tennessee share. By signing it, they agree to accept **only** what is written in the Islamic will (the 1/8 or 1/4).

### 3. Requirements for the Waiver to be Valid

For your AI agent to produce a legally binding result in Tennessee, the waiver must meet these criteria:

* **In Writing:** It must be a formal document.
* **Fair Disclosure:** Both spouses must be transparent about their finances (assets/debts) before signing.
* **Voluntary:** It cannot be signed under pressure.
* **Independent Counsel:** It is highly recommended (and often required for strength in court) that the spouse has the chance to review the waiver with their own lawyer.

### 4. Why Your AI Agent Needs This

If your agent writes a will but doesn't include this waiver, a disgruntled relative or a confused court could allow the spouse to take 40% of the estate. This would result in the other heirs receiving less than their Shariah-mandated shares, effectively breaking the "Islamic" nature of the will.
