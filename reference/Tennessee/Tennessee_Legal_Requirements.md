Compliance with TN State Law
Execution (T.C.A. § 32-1-104):

Must be in writing and signed by the testator.

Two Witnesses: Must sign in the presence of the testator and each other.

Holographic Wills (T.C.A. § 32-1-105): Valid if entirely in the testator's handwriting and signed; requires two witnesses to verify handwriting during probate.

The Spousal Elective Share Conflict (T.C.A. § 31-4-101):

Risk: In TN, a surviving spouse has a legal right to "elect" against a will. Depending on the marriage length, they can claim 10% to 40% of the estate.

Conflict: This often exceeds the Islamic spousal share — 1/8 or 1/4 for a wife, 1/4 or 1/2 for a husband (depending on whether children exist).

Solution: For the will to be "Islamically compliant," the surviving spouse (husband or wife) should sign a "Post-nuptial Waiver of Elective Share" to agree to the Islamic portion only.

Guardianship: TN courts prioritize the "best interest of the child," but a will is the primary place to nominate a Muslim guardian.
