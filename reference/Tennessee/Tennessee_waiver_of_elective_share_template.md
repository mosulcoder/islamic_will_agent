Description:
Below is a template for a **Waiver of Elective Share** tailored for Tennessee (**T.C.A. § 31-4-102**). This document is designed to be executed alongside an Islamic Will to ensure the surviving spouse agrees to accept the Sharia-mandated shares rather than the larger percentage allowed by Tennessee state law.

## **WAIVER OF ELECTIVE SHARE AND BENEFITS**

**(Pursuant to T.C.A. § 31-4-102)**

**STATE OF TENNESSEE**
**COUNTY OF [COUNTY NAME]**

### **1. PARTIES**

This Waiver is made and executed this ____ day of _________**, 20**, by **[SPOUSE NAME]** (hereinafter "Undersigned"), being the spouse of **[TESTATOR NAME]** (hereinafter "Testator").

### **2. PURPOSE AND INTENT**

The Undersigned acknowledges that the Testator has executed a Last Will and Testament intended to be compliant with **Sunni Islamic Law (Shariah)**.

The Undersigned further understands that the Islamic Law of Inheritance may provide a share (typically **1/8 or 1/4**) that is different from the Tennessee statutory share. It is the Undersigned’s intent to waive any statutory rights in order to facilitate the distribution of the estate in accordance with the religious requirements of the Islamic Will.

* **The Right to Exempt Property** (T.C.A. § 30-2-101).
* **The Right to Homestead** (T.C.A. § 30-2-201).

### **4. DISCLOSURE OF ASSETS**
