**6.1 Limitation:**
These voluntary bequests (*Wasiyyah*) shall not exceed **one-third (1/3)** of my net estate after payment of funeral expenses and debts, in accordance with the hadith of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the consensus of Muslim scholars.

**6.2 Specific Bequests:**

(a) I bequeath to **[CHARITY / RECIPIENT NAME]**, [ADDRESS / DESCRIPTION], the sum of **$[AMOUNT]** / **[X]%** of my net estate, for the purpose of [SPECIFIED PURPOSE — e.g., "Islamic education," "maintenance of [Masjid name]," "as Sadaqah Jariyah (ongoing charity)"].

(b) I bequeath to **[NAME]**, [RELATIONSHIP], the sum of **$[AMOUNT]** / **[X]%** of my net estate. [Note if non-Muslim: This bequest is permitted under Islamic Law as a voluntary gift and does not constitute Mirath.]

*[Add additional bequests as needed, ensuring total does not exceed 1/3 of net estate]*

**6.3 Failure of Bequest:**
If any bequest recipient predeceases me, or if the designated charity ceases to exist, the lapsed bequest shall revert to the residuary estate and be distributed as Mirath.

---

### ARTICLE VII — DISTRIBUTION OF ESTATE (*MIRATH — ISLAMIC INHERITANCE*)

**7.1 Declaration of Intent:**
The remainder of my estate, after the payments and bequests described in Articles IV, V, and VI, shall be distributed to my heirs in accordance with the **Islamic Law of Inheritance (*Fara'id*)**, as interpreted by the [Hanafi / Shafi'i] school of jurisprudence. If there is any conflict between the specific shares stated below and the Fara'id calculation, the Fara'id calculation as performed by a qualified Islamic scholar shall control.

**7.2 Distribution:**

*[INSERT CALCULATED DISTRIBUTION — Examples shown below for common scenarios]*

---

**EXAMPLE A — Married with children (Wife + 2 Sons + 1 Daughter):**

(a) To my wife, **[WIFE NAME]**: One-eighth **(1/8 = 12.5%)** of the net estate;

(b) To my children collectively, the remaining **seven-eighths (7/8)** of the net estate, distributed such that each son receives twice the share of each daughter (2:1 ratio per Islamic Law):
- **[SON 1 NAME]**: Two parts of five (2/5 of the 7/8 residue = 28% of net estate);
- **[SON 2 NAME]**: Two parts of five (2/5 of the 7/8 residue = 28% of net estate);
- **[DAUGHTER NAME]**: One part of five (1/5 of the 7/8 residue = 17.5% of net estate);

---

**EXAMPLE B — Married, no children (Wife + Father + Mother):**

(a) To my wife, **[WIFE NAME]**: One-quarter **(1/4 = 25%)** of the net estate;
(b) To my father, **[FATHER NAME]**: The residue after all fixed shares — approximately [X]%;
(c) To my mother, **[MOTHER NAME]**: One-third **(1/3 ≈ 33.3%)** of the net estate;

---

**EXAMPLE C — Widower with children (Husband + 3 Daughters):**

(a) To my husband, **[HUSBAND NAME]**: One-quarter **(1/4 = 25%)** of the net estate;
(b) To my daughters collectively, **two-thirds (2/3 ≈ 66.7%)** of the net estate, divided equally among them;
(c) **Radd (Return):** If a surplus remains after the above fixed shares, it shall be returned to the daughters proportionally, in accordance with the Hanafi school.

---

**EXAMPLE D — Married with two daughters, no sons (Wife + 2 Daughters + Father + Mother):**

(a) **Al-Aul (Proportional Reduction):** Because the total fixed shares exceed the whole estate (summing to 27/24), all shares are proportionally reduced (the denominator is increased to 27) in accordance with Islamic Law;
(b) To my wife, **[WIFE NAME]**: Three parts of twenty-seven **(3/27 ≈ 11.1%)** of the net estate;
(c) To my daughters collectively, sixteen parts of twenty-seven **(16/27 ≈ 59.3%)** of the net estate, divided equally among them;
(d) To my father, **[FATHER NAME]**: Four parts of twenty-seven **(4/27 ≈ 14.8%)** of the net estate;
(e) To my mother, **[MOTHER NAME]**: Four parts of twenty-seven **(4/27 ≈ 14.8%)** of the net estate;

---

**7.3 Predeceased Heir:**
If any heir named above predeceases me, their share shall be redistributed among the surviving heirs according to the rules of Islamic Inheritance Law (*Fara'id*), not by representation (per stirpes), unless the rules of *Fara'id* specifically provide otherwise.

**7.4 Non-Muslim Heirs:**
Any heir who is not a Muslim at the time of my death shall not receive a share of the Mirath (Islamic inheritance). Such person may, however, receive any Wasiyyah bequest I have specifically designated for them in Article VI, not to exceed 1/3 of the net estate in total.

Address: _______________________________________

**8.2 Alternate Guardian:**
If [GUARDIAN NAME] is unable or unwilling to serve, I nominate **[ALTERNATE GUARDIAN FULL NAME]**, of [ALTERNATE ADDRESS], as alternate Guardian.

Address: _______________________________________

**8.3 Islamic Upbringing:**
It is my express wish and fervent desire that my minor children be raised in the **Islamic faith (Sunni tradition)**, receive regular Islamic education, attend the masjid regularly, and be raised in a Muslim household. I request that Tennessee courts give full weight to this wish when evaluating any guardianship proceedings, consistent with T.C.A. § 36-6-106.

**8.4 Bond:**
I waive the requirement that the Guardian post a bond.

---

### ARTICLE IX — NO-CONTEST CLAUSE (*IN TERROREM*)

If any person, whether or not named herein, directly or indirectly contests or challenges the validity of this Will or any of its provisions, or seeks to set aside or impair the operation of this Will, either in whole or in part, through any legal proceeding, then such person shall forfeit any and all rights they may have under this Will, and their share shall be distributed as if such person had predeceased me, to the remaining heirs in accordance with Islamic Law.
