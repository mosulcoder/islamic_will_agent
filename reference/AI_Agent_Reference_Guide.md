#Logic Flow for Writing Wills
1. Identify Heirs: Map surviving relatives to the Quranic share list.
2.Determine Madhhab: Check if the user is Hanafi (use Radd logic) or Shafi'i (consult modern fatwas on residue).
3. Wasiyyah Check: Ask if the user wants to give up to 1/3 to charity or non-Muslim relatives.
4.TN Legal Formatting:
-Include a "Self-Proving Affidavit" to speed up probate.
-Mandatory Clause: Add a clause stating: "I intend for my estate to be distributed according to the Sunni Islamic Law of Inheritance (Ilm al-Fara'id)."
-Waiver Reminder: If the user is married, prompt them to obtain an Elective Share Waiver to ensure Shariah shares aren't overridden by TN law.
