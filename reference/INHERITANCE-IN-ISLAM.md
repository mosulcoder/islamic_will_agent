**ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS**
In the Name of Allah, the Fashioner, the All-Knowledgeable.
My sincere appreciation goes to my teacher, Sheikh Musa Alhaji
Baba from whom I learnt a lot. This book is a manifestation of just one of the
things he taught me. I did not only learn the theoretical aspect of inheritance,
but I had the opportunity to assist him a number of times when he is called
upon by families of deceaseds to help in the distribution of their estates. That
is when you will see men being given pots and women will inherit caps. It
may be funny but very heart-breaking. And since it’s an injunction of Allah,
it has to be done like that.
Muhammad Sa’idu Jimada was the first to advice that the articles I
started as blog contents at www.inheritanceinislam.blogspot.com be
compiled into a book. He also encouraged me to incorporate it into the
Foundation’s website (which I had the privilege to design) instead of starting
an entire new site. I enjoy his tremendous support in every ramification. May
Allah reward you abundantly. Special gratitude goes to every member of my
family, nuclear and extended, for providing an enabling environment which
facilitated the writing of this book.
I also thank my very good friend and teacher, Mallam Shuaibu Daja
for his useful advice and wonderful assistance. He is always at my beck-andcall despite his tight schedule. My deep appreciation goes to Alhaji
Muhammadu Salawu and Dr Adamu AbdulMalik for their fatherly roles and
valuable time. To Ibrahim S. Ahmed and Mahmud Umar, I say thank you!

**FORWARD**
In the Name of Allah, the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful. May
the peace and blessings of Allah be on the noblest Apostle of Allah,
Muhammad (peace be upon him), his household and followers till the Day of
Judgement. _Amin_ .
It is a great privilege for me to have gone through this write-up
authored by a brilliant, intelligent and hardworking brother on an important
aspect of Islam: Inheritance. For the fact that death is a channel through
which every living soul must pass through, when it comes, the deceased
usually leaves behind an estate which is to be shared among his relations as
ordained by Allah. Therefore, without the knowledge of inheritance, an
important commandment of Allah will not be carried out or will be done
wrongly. So, the importance of this knowledge cannot be over emphasised.
Though it is _fardul-kifaya_ not _fardul-‘ayn_, the Holy Prophet (peace be upon
him) encouraged Muslims to learn it as quoted by the author from Ibn
Majah’s collection.
This work is intended to give the reader a clear understanding of the
subject matter as it is simplified with good examples and authorities from the
Qur’an and Hadith. The writer has gone extra-mile to explain some basics
before discussing certain aspects for more clarity. This is to enable and
encourage Muslim brothers and sisters especially those that acquired strictly
western education to better appreciate this knowledge despite its complexity.
I therefore, pray to Almighty Allah to bless the author for this
wonderful work aimed at the propagation of knowledge in the _Ummah_ . I also
pray to Allah to enrich Islam with the likes of this scholar so that they make
useful contributions through writings in order to uplift the religion and to the
benefit of mankind in general. _Amin_ .

**INTRODUCTION**
In the name of Allah, the First, the Responsive.
Before now, books on inheritance meant for English readers
concentrated more on explaining the shares of each heir probably with one or
two examples only. But inheritance problems are diverse that mere knowing
the shares of the heirs does not provide answers to them. In fact, these shares
change depending on the circumstance. So what is required is a TEMPLATE
that can solve any kind of inheritance problem. That is what this book seeks
to achieve.
The distinguishing feature of this write-up is that almost half of it is
dedicated to elucidating the Mathematics of inheritance because the secret of
solving inheritance problems is to know the relationship between numbers.
These are _: tamathul_, _tadakhul_, _tabayin_ and _tawafuq_ . Nevertheless, with the
realisation that most people detest Mathematics, attempt has being made to
simplify it. Some topics in elementary Mathematics like LCM, HCF and
prime numbers were reviewed for better understanding of a few concepts.
Solving inheritance problems is not done by trial and error. There are
standard rules governing it. For that reason, 22 rules of (total) exclusion, 14
rules of partial exclusion and 26 rules (coded A – Z) of determining base
number ( _aslul mas-ala_ ) were developed. A total of 48 examples with
solutions were used to apply all the rules.
As this book is intended to provide basic knowledge of inheritance,
advanced topics which to my judgement are rare occurrences like
inheritances of foetus, hermaphrodite and missing person among others were
left out. They have been suggested for Further Reading.
I pray that Allah accepts this effort as an act of _Ibadah_ .

**PREAMBLE**

Death is inevitable. As a result, Islam being a complete way of life
has spelt out how the deceased’s estate should be shared among his heirs. By
estate, we mean the entire property a deceased leaves behind such as houses,
cars, clothes, furniture, land, farm, jewellery, cash (at hand and in bank),
shares, bonds, and so on including socks and underwear; everything.
_Subhanal-Lah_ .
It should be noted that when a Muslim dies, the obligations to be
taken out of his estate (in order of priority are):
1. _Kafn_ (shroud) and other basic expenses relating to the funeral like
grave digger’s wage, transportation to cemetery, etc if they are to be paid for.
A surviving husband is responsible for the shroud and burial expenses of his
deceased wife if she is not endowed. There is difference of opinion in respect
of a wealthy woman. Some scholars said that the husband is still responsible
while others are of the view that they should be paid from her estate.
2. Repayment of his outstanding debt.
Narrated Abu Hurairah: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon
him) said: “A believer’s soul remains in suspense (cannot enter Paradise)
until all his debts are paid off.” **Ahmad, Ibn Majah, and Tirmidhy**
**Collections.**
Narrated Muhammad ibn Abdullah ibn Jahsh: The Messenger of
Allah (peace be upon him) said: “By Him in whose hand Muhammad’s soul
is, if a man were to be killed in Allah’s path then come to life, be killed again
in Allah’s path then come to life, and be killed once more in Allah’s path
then come to life owing a debt, he would not enter Paradise till his debt was
paid.” **Bukhari Collection.**
Generally, debt can be owed to fellow humans or to Allah e.g.
unpaid _Zakat_ . The former has to be repaid, no questions about that. Scholars
differ as regards repayment of debt due to Allah. Some are of the view that it
should be repaid while others are in support of non-repayment. A third view
is that it should be repaid if and only if the deceased instructs same.
3. Fulfilment of his will.
Provided it does not exceed one-third (1/3) of the entire estate and
it’s not in favour of an heir. If any or both of these conditions are not
satisfied, the validity of the will is subject to approval of all the heirs,
otherwise, its void.
4. The rightful heirs then inherit the remaining estate.

**Significance of acquiring and teaching the Laws of Inheritance**
Narrated Abu Hurairah: The Prophet (peace be upon him) said:
“Learn the _Fara’id_ (laws of inheritance) and teach it, for it is half of
knowledge and it is (easily) forgotten, and it is the first thing to be taken
(away) from my nation.” **Ibn Majah Collection.**
Narrated Abdullah ibn Mas’ud: Allah’s Messenger (peace be upon
him) said to me, “Acquire the knowledge and impart it to the people. Acquire
the knowledge of _Fara’id_ (laws of inheritance) and teach it to the people,
learn the Qur'an and teach it to the people; for I am a person who has to
depart this world and the knowledge will be taken away and turmoil will
appear to such an extent that two people will not agree in regard to a case of
inheritance distribution and find none who would decide between them.”
**Tirmithy Collection.**

**CHAPTER ONE**
**MALE HEIRS**
Male heirs of a deceased are fifteen (15):
1. Son.
This refers to a legitimate male child. A man can only have a
legitimate child after contracting a legally (Shari’ah) acceptable marriage
with a woman outside his prohibited degree; while a woman can have a
legitimate child with or without a formal marriage contract. This will be
discussed in details under Inheritance of Children in chapter three.
2. Grandson or his descendant.
Everyone has two categories of relatives: agnates and cognates.
Agnates are relatives whose connection is traceable through the father or
male line such as paternal grandparents, paternal uncle, paternal aunt, etc.,
while cognates are relatives whose connection is traceable through the
mother or the female line like maternal grandparents, maternal uncle,
maternal aunt and so on. Now, only agnates are eligible to inherit the estate
of a deceased; meaning that all cognates are NOT bona-fide heirs except
uterine brothers/sisters and maternal grandmother to whom the Qur'an
assigns a share (more on this later).
Therefore, the grandson referred to here as a male heir is the one
through a son. The grandson through a daughter is a non-heir. For example,
‘A’ (who may either be a male or female) has a son ‘B’, who also begets a
son ‘C’. When ‘A’ dies, his/her son ‘B’ inherits from him/her as the case in
(1) above. ‘C’ is excluded. We shall discuss ‘exclusion’ in the next chapter.
However, if ‘B’ is absent at the time ‘A’ dies; meaning that ‘B’ died before
‘A’, then ‘C’ the grandson will represent or stand in place of ‘B’ and inherit
from ‘A’. I call this phenomenon “jumping.”
Assuming ‘C’ has a son ‘D’ who also has a son ‘E’, ‘E’ will inherit
from ‘A’ if and only if ‘B’, ‘C’ and ‘D’ are absent. That is what is meant by
“his descendants,” i.e. the descendants of grandson ‘C’. Put in another way, a
grandson will inherit from his grandfather if his father is absent. Likewise, a
great-grandson will inherit from his great-grandfather if his father and
grandfather are absent. Now, very important. This rule applies to ONLY
sons. That is, ‘A’ (may be of any gender) but ‘B’, ‘C’, ‘D’, ‘E’ ... must all be
males.
If ‘C’ were to be a female and she marries ‘X’ who has a father ‘Y’
and grandfather ‘Z’, and the marriage is blessed with a son ‘D’; when ‘A’
dies, ‘C’ will inherit from him/her if ‘B’ is absent. But ‘D’ CANNOT inherit
from ‘A’ even if ‘B’ and ‘C’ are absent because ‘A’ and ‘B’ are his cognates.
‘D’ is only entitled to inherit from his parents ‘X’ and ‘C’, paternal


3


grandfather ‘Y’ (in the absence of ‘X’) and paternal great-grandfather ‘Z’ (in
the absence of both ‘X’ and ‘Y’).
In summary, the grandson entitled to inheritance is son’s son, not
daughter’s son. Also the descendants of son’s son (‘D’ and ‘E’ as in the first
example above) will “jump” and inherit from ‘A’ provided ‘B’ and ‘C’ are
absent. This trend will continue down the line as far as a female does not
appear. If a female emerges, she will also “jump” but her children (male and
female) will not, because to them the line is cognate.
3. Father.
This is straight forward. A father shall inherit from his son or
daughter.
4. Paternal grandfather or his ascendant.
By now it’s clear that maternal grandfather is a non-heir. So, a
paternal grandfather will inherit from his grandson or granddaughter in the
absence of his son. Using the illustration above, given that ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’ and
‘D’ are all males and ‘E’ is either male or female; when ‘E’ passes on, ‘D’
(his or her father) will inherit from him or her as the case in (3) above. In the
absence of ‘D’, ‘C’ (the paternal grandfather) will inherit from ‘E’. The same
ruling applies to ascendants ‘B’ and ‘A’.
5. Full brother.
He has the same father and same mother with the deceased.
6. Consanguine brother.
He has the same father but different mother with the deceased.
7. Uterine brother.
He has the same mother but different father with the deceased.
8. Full brother’s son or his male descendant.
We said that in the absence of the son, the grandson replaces him. If
the grandson is also absent, the great-grandson “jumps” and take the place of
the son. If a female appears, she equally has the privilege of “jumping,” then
the line terminates. The difference here is that the descendants all have to be
males; such that when a full brother is absent, his son replaces him and the
trend continues. Whenever a female emerges, she is not entitled to “jump,”
and the line terminates. That is what is meant by “male descendants.”
9. Consanguine brother’s son or his male descendant.
10. Full paternal uncle.
Father’s elder or younger brother from the same father and mother.
11. Half paternal uncle.
Father’s elder or younger brother from the same father but different
mother.
12. Full paternal uncle’s son or his male descendant.
13. Half paternal uncle’s son or his male descendant.

14. Husband.
A husband will inherit from his wife if she dies before him.
Likewise, if a man divorces his wife with one or two pronouncements (i.e.
revocable divorce) and she dies WHILE in her _Iddah_ (i.e. waiting period), he
will inherit from her because technically, she remains his wife. However, if
the divorce is irrevocable (three pronouncements), he will NOT inherit from
her whether the _Iddah_ has expired or not.
15. Patron.
A man who sets a slave free will inherit from the slave if the later has
no heir.

**FEMALE HEIRS**
Female heirs are nine (9):
1. Daughter.
A daughter will inherit from her father and mother. This provision
does not extend to her children. That is to say, her children cannot replace or
represent her to inherit from their (maternal) grandfather or (maternal)
grandmother in her absence.
2. Son’s daughter.
If a son has a daughter, she will inherit from the son’s father or
mother (her paternal grandparents) in the absence of the son. The rule also
applies to son’s son’s daughter, son’s son’s son’s daughter, and so on. This
has been explained earlier under “grandson or his descendants.”
3. Mother.
When a son or daughter passes on, his/her mother is entitled to a part
of his/her estate. She cannot be excluded no-matter what happens.
4. Either grandmother.
In the absence of mother, both grandmothers i.e. maternal and
paternal will inherit from a deceased. Here, the “ascendant rule” applies,
such that if one or both grandmothers is/are absent, the great-grandmothers
will take their place(s) and inherit from the deceased.
5. Full sister.
6. Consanguine sister.
7. Uterine sister.
8. Wife.
A wife will inherit from her late husband. She cannot be excluded.
She will also inherit from him if he dies after divorcing her with one or two
pronouncements (revocable divorce) provided her _Iddah_ has NOT elapsed.
But if the divorce is irrevocable (three pronouncements), she will not inherit
from him whether her _Iddah_ has elapsed or not. However, if the husband
were to be “insensitive” and divorces his wife irrevocably DURING his final


5


illness in which he dies, the four schools of Islamic jurisprudence have
divergent opinions:
a) As-Shafi’i - She will NOT inherit from him whether or not the _Iddah_
has expired.
b) Abu-Hanifa - If the _Iddah_ has not expired, she will inherit from him,
otherwise, she will become a non-heir.
c) Ahmad ibn Hanbal - She has the right to inherit from him whether
the _Iddah_ has expired or not provided she has not married another
person.
d) Malik - She will inherit from him even if the _Iddah_ has expired or
she has married another person.
7. Patroness.
A woman who sets a slave free will inherit from him/her so long as
he/she has no heir.

**NON-HEIRS**
Non-heirs are those relatives not entitled to any part of the
deceased’s estate. They include:
1. Daughter’s sons and daughters and their descendants.
They will inherit through their father’s (daughter’s husband’s) line
only. Their mother’s line is cognate.
2. Sister’s sons and daughters and their descendants.
This refers to all the three types of sisters: full, consanguine and
uterine. Their children will inherit through their father’s line only as the case
with daughter’s children.
3. Daughters of full brother.
4. Daughters of consanguine brother.
5. Daughters of full brother’s son.
6. Daughters of consanguine brother’s son
7. Sons and daughters of uterine brother.
8. Sons and daughters of uterine sister.
9. Daughters of full paternal uncle.
10. Daughters of half paternal uncle.
11. Daughters of full paternal uncle’s son.
12. Daughters of half paternal uncle’s son.
13. Paternal aunt, her children and their descendants.
14. Maternal uncle, his children and their descendants.
15. Maternal aunt, her children and their descendants.
16. Maternal grandfather’s mother.
Given that maternal grandmother (the wife of maternal grandfather)
is an heir in the absence of mother, if the maternal grandmother is also


6


absent, who takes her place? Her mother. Not her husband’s mother.
Therefore, maternal grandfather’s mother is a non-heir.
17. Paternal grandmother’s father.
As in (11) above, paternal grandmother is also an heir in the absence
of mother; but in her absence, her mother replaces her, not her father.

**IMPEDIMENTS TO INHERITANCE**
Impediment means barring an heir from getting his/her share of the
deceased’s estate due to certain circumstances. These include:
1. Murder.
An heir who deliberately murders the deceased will neither inherit
from the latter’s estate nor from the _diyya_ (i.e. blood money). If the murder is
accidental, he/she will inherit from the deceased's estate but not from the
_diyya_ .
2. Difference of religion.
A Muslim does not inherit from a non-Muslim relative no-matter
how close they are, and vice-versa. For instance, a Muslim father who has a
non-Muslim son will not inherit from him and the other way round.
3. Simultaneous death.
When two or more people who are rightful heirs of one another like
father and son, husband and wife, etc die at the same time maybe under a
collapsed building or in similar circumstance, and it is uncertain who died
first, they will not inherit from each other. But if it’s clear that the husband
died before the wife for instance, she will be listed among the surviving heirs
of the husband and given her share of his estate. Thereafter, her heirs will
inherit her estate PLUS her share of the husband’s estate.
4. _Li'an_ (Cursing for adultery).
This happens when a man denies the paternity of his wife’s
pregnancy and they end up swearing and cursing themselves as prescribed by
Allah in the Qur'an (24: 6 – 9). “And for those who accuse their wives, but
have no witnesses except themselves, let the testimony of one of them be
four testimonies (i.e. testifies four times) by Allah that he is one of those who
speak the truth. And the fifth (testimony) (should be) the invoking of the
Curse of Allah on him if he be of those who tell a lie (against her). But it
shall avert the punishment (of stoning to death) from her, if she bears witness
four times by Allah, that he (her husband) is telling a lie. And the fifth
(testimony) should be that the Wrath of Allah be upon her if he (her husband)
speaks the truth.” The child that results will inherit from his mother only.
5. Slavery.
A slave and everything he owns belongs to his master. As far as he
remains a slave, he will not inherit from his relatives and they will not inherit


7


from him. The logic is that if he inherits, whatever he gets belongs to his
master and if his relatives are to inherit from him, they will actually be
inheriting part of the master’s estate.
6. “Emergency marriage”.
This refers to a marriage that takes place when either the bride or
groom is in a state of ill health with a 50:50 percentage of survival and death
or the percentage of death is higher. The healthy partner will not inherit from
the sick one if he/she dies as a result of that illness. Conversely, the sick
partner will not inherit from the healthy one supposing the latter incidentally
dies before the former. But if the sick partner fully recovers, then either of
them dies, this rule will not apply.


8


**CHAPTER TWO**
**EXCLUSION**
Exclusion means preventing a rightful heir from having any share of
the deceased’s estate due to the PRESENCE of another heir. The principle
behind who excludes who is the degree of closeness to the deceased. The
closer relatives will exclude those who are not so close. For example, son
will exclude grandson. A grandson can only inherit in the absence of a son
since the latter is closer to the deceased than the former. Note that there is a
difference between exclusion and impediments to inheritance. In exclusion, a
“stronger” heir eliminates a “weaker” heir while impediment has to do with
preventing an heir from inheriting due to circumstances like murder,
difference of religion, slavery, etc.
There are two types of exclusion: total and partial. The definition
above refers to total exclusion. Partial exclusion means reducing the share of
the estate an heir should have gotten due to the existence of another heir. For
instance, a husband inherits half (½) of his wife's estate if she has no child,
but supposing she has a child even if from a previous husband, he gets onequarter (¼) of her estate. This reduction from ½ to ¼ is called partial
exclusion. Details in chapter five. Meanwhile, we intend to concentrate on
total exclusion. So, unless otherwise specified, whenever we say “exclusion,”
we mean “total exclusion.”
Now, among the heirs (male and female), there are those I call “basic
heirs,” because they cannot be excluded irrespective of who is present. They
are: son, daughter, father, mother, husband and wife. The worst that can
happen to them is to be partially excluded. Exclusion is quite a complex
concept. Thus, we will try to simplify it using analogies. Do not mind any
repetitions. They are for easier and clearer understanding.
Let's say that an individual ‘X’ (who may either be a male or female)
has two sons ‘A’ and ‘B’. ‘A’ has 2 sons and a daughter while ‘B’ has a son
and 3 daughters. This means that ‘X’ has 7 grandchildren (3 sons, 4
daughters).
a) If ‘A’ and ‘B’ are absent (i.e. have died), when ‘X’ eventually passes
on, the 7 grandchildren will replace or represent their fathers and
inherit from his estate.
b) Supposing ‘A’ and ‘B’ are both present at the time ‘X’ dies, they will
exclude their children from having any share of ‘X’s’ inheritance.
c) If at the time ‘X’ passes on, only ‘A’ is present, (i.e. ‘B’ has died
before ‘X’), the 4 children of ‘B’ cannot take the place of their father
to inherit from ‘X’ due to the presence of ‘A’. This means that ‘A’
will exclude both his children and the children of his brother ‘B’. But


9


this rule applies exclusively when ‘A’ is a SON and not a daughter.
Therefore,
**Rule 1** : A son excludes ALL grandchildren.
Modifying the analogy a bit, if ‘A’ were to be a daughter and ‘B’ a son, what
happens?
a) Assuming ‘A’ and ‘B’ are both absent when ‘X’ dies, only the 4
children of ‘B’ will inherit from him. The children of daughter ‘A’
are non-heirs.
b) If ‘A’ and ‘B’ are present at the time ‘X’ passes on, they will exclude
the children of ‘B’.
c) On the other hand, if ‘B’ died before ‘X’, and ‘A’ is the only
surviving child, she will NOT exclude the children of ‘B’. However,
this does not mean that ‘B’s’ children will take the place of their
father or will be entitled to their father’s share of the estate. A new
sharing formula is to be created for them [We shall see the details of
this sharing formula with numeric examples in subsequent chapters
_Insha Allah_ . Here we are just interested in discussing who excludes
who and in what circumstance(s)]. This brings us to the next rule of
exclusion.
**Rule 2** : A daughter does not exclude grandchildren [i.e. children of her late
brother(s)].
Supposing an individual ‘Z’ (either male or female) has a son ‘P’ and
two daughters ‘Q’ and ‘R’. ‘P’ is married and is blessed with daughters only.
Whether ‘Q’ and ‘R’ are married with or without children is immaterial
because it makes no difference. Their children are non-heirs.
a) ‘P’ dies before ‘Z’. When ‘Z’ passes on, ‘Q’ and ‘R’ will exclude the
grandchildren.
b) If ‘P’ has at least a son; in the same circumstance, ‘Q’ and ‘R’ will
NOT exclude the grandchildren. However, they (the grandchildren)
will not be entitled to the share of the estate their father (‘P’) should
have gotten. A new sharing formula is created for them. Hence,
**Rule 3** : Two or more daughters exclude strictly granddaughters.
**Rule 4** : Two or more daughters do not exclude grandchildren comprising of
at least a grandson.
This pair of rules has a wide range of application.
1. Inheritance of second and third generation heirs.
The children of the deceased are the first generation heirs; his/her
grandchildren are the second generation heirs, while his/her greatgrandchildren are the third generation heirs. Let’s say a deceased ‘W’ (male
or female) has a son ‘K’ who in turn begets a son ‘L’ and two daughters ‘M’


10


and ‘N’. ‘L’ grew up, got married and is blessed with five (5) daughters. In
this case,
‘K’ = first generation heir of ‘W’.
‘L’, ‘M’ and ‘N’ = second generation heirs of ‘W’.
Five daughters = third generation heirs of ‘W’.
If son ‘K’ and grandson ‘L’ pass on before ‘W’, ‘M’ and ‘N’ the
surviving second generation heirs will exclude all the 5 daughters because
they are all female. Supposing there is at least a son among the third
generation heirs, ‘M’ and ‘N’ cannot exclude them, rather a new sharing
formula is created for them.
This is quite straight-forward. We can complicate it a bit. ‘W’ has
three children. A son ‘A’ and two daughters ‘B’ and ‘C’. ‘A’ begets 2 sons
‘S’, ‘T’ and two daughters ‘U’, ‘V’. ‘B’ has two sons ‘X’ and ‘Y’. ‘C’ is
blessed with a daughter ‘Z’. ‘S’ has 4 daughters, ‘T’ has 2 daughters, ‘U’ has
a son and 2 daughters, ‘V’ has 2 sons, ‘X’ has a son and a daughter, ‘Y’ has 3
sons and ‘Z’ has a daughter. Confusing? Not really. Taking some moment to
sketch the family tree will help.
a) When ‘W’ dies and the status-quo remains (i.e. no one died before
him/her), ‘A’, ‘B’ and ‘C’ (the first generation heirs) will inherit
from him/her. The second and third generation heirs will all be
excluded due to the presence of son ‘A’.
b) If ‘A’ died before ‘W’, ‘B’ and ‘C’ will NOT exclude ‘S’, ‘T’, ‘U’
and ‘V’ because ‘S’ and ‘T’ are sons. Note that ‘X’, ‘Y’ and ‘Z’ are
non-heirs (grandchildren through daughters).
c) In a situation whereby all the first generation heirs (‘A’, ‘B’ and ‘C’)
as well as ‘S’ and ‘T’ are absent, ‘U’ and ‘V’ will exclude the
daughters of ‘S’ and ‘T’ from inheriting from ‘W’ because only the
six (6) of them are rightful heirs. Others are non-heirs.
d) Supposing ‘T’ has a son in addition to his 2 daughters, in the absence
of ‘S’ and ‘T’ and the first generation heirs, ‘U’ and ‘V’ cannot
exclude the seven rightful heirs of the third generation (i.e. 4
daughters of ‘S’ and a son and 2 daughters of ‘T’). The seven (7) of
them will inherit from ‘W’. The presence of ‘T’s’ son will entitle not
only his daughters but also all the daughters of ‘S’ to a share of
‘W’s’ estate.
.
2. Another application of this pair of rules (though in a modified form)
is when full sisters are inheriting along with consanguine sisters. We
recall that sisters’ children are non-heirs. So the possibilities are as
follows:
**Rule 5** : One full sister does not exclude consanguine sister(s).


11


**Rule 6** : Two or more full sisters exclude strictly consanguine sisters.
**Rule 7** : Two or more full sisters do not exclude consanguine sisters if a
consanguine brother is also present.
The slight modification is that both sisters (full and consanguine) are
in the same generational level, unlike the previous situations whereby two or
more females in one generation will exclude strictly female(s) in a generation
lower than theirs.

Next, let’s consider a set of heirs in a particular order. I call the set
“alpha” and it’s made up of:

  - Full brother

  - Consanguine brother

  - Full brother’s son or his descendant

  - Consanguine brother’s son or his descendant

  - Full paternal uncle

  - Half paternal uncle

  - Full paternal uncle’s son or his descendant

  - Half paternal uncle’s son or his descendant
The order of arrangement is VERY important when it comes to
exclusion because a member excludes all those below him. For instance, if a
full brother is present, every other member is excluded; likewise when a full
brother is absent, a consanguine brother if available excludes other members,
and so on. Therefore,
**Rule 8** : Full brother excludes consanguine brother and those below him.
**Rule 9** : Consanguine brother excludes full brother’s son (or his descendant)
and those below him.
**Rule 10** : Full brother’s son (or his descendant) excludes consanguine
brother’s son (or his descendant) and those below him.
**Rule 11** : Consanguine brother’s son (or his descendant) excludes full
paternal uncle and those below him.
**Rule 12** : Full paternal uncle excludes half paternal uncle and those below
him.
**Rule 13** : Half paternal uncle excludes full paternal uncle’s son (or his
descendant), his own son or his son’s descendant.
**Rule 14** : Full paternal uncle’s son (or his descendant) excludes half paternal
uncle’s son (or his descendant).
Note that any heir (outside alpha) that can exclude a full brother
automatically excludes all other members of the set. Thus,
**Rule 15** : Son excludes full brother.
**Rule 16** : Grandson through son excludes full brother.


12


This is applicable in the absence of a son. Recall that grandson
through daughter is a non-heir. Also the rule trickles down to descendants
provided they are ALL sons; such that great-grandson excludes full brother
in the absence of son and grandson.
**Rule 17** : Father excludes full brother.
Observe the connection between rules 15 and 16. The son of a
deceased will exclude the deceased’s full brother. In the absence of the son,
the grandson will exercise the same power and exclude the full brother.
Conversely, father excludes full brother as well (rule 17). Now, if the father
is not present, who takes his place? Of course his father i.e. the deceased’s
paternal grandfather. But does the grandfather in addition to having a share
of the estate also have the authority to exclude full brother? Even the
Companions of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) differed on this
because the ruling is neither clearly stated in the Qur’an nor did such a
circumstance arose during the lifetime of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon
him) to necessitate a verdict.
The first opinion is that grandfather excludes full brother because he
inherits all the privileges of the father; just like the grandson inherits all
rights and privileges of a son. The second view is that grandfather does not
have the ability to exclude full brother even though he can “jump” and
replace the father to inherit from the deceased. One of the arguments of the
proponents of this view (which has been adopted by majority of Jurists like
Imams Malik, As-Shafi’i, Ahmad ibn Hanbal and others) is that father
excludes his mother i.e. paternal grandmother (see below) but grandfather
cannot exclude her because he (grandfather) does not have the same status as
the father. As a result, grandfather cannot exclude full brother as a father
does.
IMPORTANT: Full and consanguine brothers are the only ones not
excluded by grandfather. It is generally agreed that grandfather excludes
other members of alpha.
**Rule 18** : Son, grandson (or his descendant) and father EACH excludes full
and consanguine sisters.
Again, grandfather does not exclude full and consanguine sisters.
**Rule 19** : Son, grandson (or his descendant), daughter, granddaughter through
a son, father and paternal grandfather (or his ascendant) EACH excludes
uterine brothers and sisters.
**Rule 20** : Mother excludes both grandmothers.
**Rule 21** : Father excludes paternal grandmother (i.e. his own mother) only.


13


**NOTE ON DIFFERENCE OF OPINION**
When the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) intended to send
Mu'adh ibn Jabal to Yemen, he asked: “How will you judge when the
occasion of deciding a case arises?” He replied: “I shall judge in accordance
with Allah's Book.” He asked: “(What will you do) if you do not find any
guidance in Allah's Book?” He replied: “(I shall act) in accordance with the
_Sunnah_ of the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him).” He asked: “(What will
you do) if you do not find any guidance in the _Sunnah_ of the Apostle of
Allah (peace be upon him) and in Allah's Book?” He replied: “I shall do my
best to form an opinion and I shall spare no effort.” The Apostle of Allah
(peace be upon him) then patted him on the breast and said: “Praise be to
Allah Who has helped the messenger of the Apostle of Allah to find
something which pleases the Apostle of Allah.” **Abu Dawud Collection.**
The following can be deduced from the Hadith:
a) The primary sources of Shari’ah (Qur’an and Sunnah/Hadith) do not
provide EXPLICIT answers to each and every problem or situation.
We will like to emphasize the word: EXPLICIT. This is because
general answers to all human problems past, present and future can
be found in either or both of them.
b) Qualified Muslims are allowed to analytically find solutions to issues
not categorically solved by the Qur’an and/or Hadith. This is called
_Ijtihad_ ; defined by Muhammad ibn Ali Al-Shawkani as quoted by
Abu Ismael al-Beirawi as “the total expenditure of effort made by a
Jurist in order to infer, with a degree of probability, the rules of
Shari’ah from their detailed evidence in the sources (i.e. Qur’an and
Hadith) in a manner the _Mujtahid_ (Jurist who does _Ijtihad_ ) feels
unable to exert any more effort.”

Sheikh Muhammad ibn Saalih al-‘Uthaymeen listed four conditions
that must be fulfilled for an _Ijtihad_ to be valid.
i. The person performing _Ijtihad_ is qualified to do so (i.e. a pious, just
and trustworthy Muslim who is knowledgeable in the understanding
and interpretation of the Qur’an and Hadith).
ii. The issue is open to _Ijtihad_ . Scholars have identified certain matters
to which _Ijtihad_ should not be exercised. They are: existence of
Allah, truthfulness of Muhammad (peace be upon him) and
authenticity of the Qur’an.
iii. The person exerts his utmost in trying to arrive at the correct ruling.
iv. The person has some form of evidence which he uses to justify his
position.


14


Thus, the first reason why differences of opinion may exist is lack of
explicit ruling in neither the Qur’an nor Hadith. Opinions may also differ due
to variation in the interpretation of a Qur’anic verse or statement of the
Prophet (peace be upon him). For example, Ibn Umar narrated: On the day of
_Al-Ahzab_ (i.e. Clans) the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “None of you
(Muslims) should offer the ‘Asr prayer but at Banu Quraiza's place.” The
‘Asr prayer became due for some of them on the way. Some of those said,
“We will not offer it till we reach it i.e. the place of Banu Quraiza,” while
some others said, “No, we will pray at this spot, for the Prophet did not mean
that for us.” Later on it was mentioned to the Prophet and he did not berate
any of the two groups. **Bukhari Collection** .
The companions understood the Prophet’s instruction differently.
The first group comprehended it literally so they delayed their prayer until
they arrived at Bani Quraiza at sunset. The second group understood it
metaphorically such that the Prophet’s intention was for them to make haste
in setting off so that by the time ‘Asr prayer becomes due, they would have
reached Bani Quraiza. So when the time of ‘Asr prayer set in and they were
still on the way, they prayed without delaying it.
Now, why did the Prophet (peace be upon him) not reprimand any of
the groups? Because each had some form of evidence which it uses to justify
its position. Then, will both of them be correct? Certainly not. The following
Hadith clarifies this:
Narrated ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr bin Al-‘As: Allah’s Apostle (peace be
upon him) said, “If a judge gives a verdict according to the best of his
knowledge and his verdict is correct (i.e. agrees with Allah and His Apostle's
verdict) he will receive a double reward, and if he gives a verdict according
to the best of his knowledge and his verdict is wrong, (i.e. against that of
Allah and His Apostle) even then he will get a reward.” **Bukhari Collection.**
Therefore, the clause “and his verdict is wrong” means that only one
opinion (out of two, three or more) is correct; yet the “incorrect” one cannot
be said to be erroneous since its proponent tried his utmost to arrive at the
correct ruling and he has some form of evidence to justify his position.
Consider this Hadith:
Narrated ‘Abdur-Rahman bin Abza: A man came to ‘Umar bin AlKhattab and said, “I became _Junub_ but no water was available.” ‘Ammar bin
Yasir said to ‘Umar, “Do you remember that you and I (became _Junub_ while
both of us) were together on a journey and you didn't pray but I rolled myself
on the ground and prayed? I informed the Prophet about it and he said, ‘It
would have been sufficient for you to do like this.’ The Prophet then stroked
lightly the earth with his hands and then blew off the dust and passed his
hands over his face and hands.” **Bukhari Collection.**


15


For the Prophet (peace be upon him) to have taught ‘Ammar the
proper way of performing _Tayammum_ means that his view was more likely
to be correct. But at the same time, ‘Umar was not told that he was wrong as
he tried his best to arrive at the correct ruling and he had some form of
evidence to justify his position; which is (and Allah knows best) that prayer
cannot be performed in a state of impurity and since he has no access to
water, then prayer is not binding on him.
In conclusion, when Jurists differ on an issue, a Muslim has the right
to pick any of the views. However, when one opinion is more popular than
the other, he is advised to choose the former.


16


**CHAPTER THREE**
**INHERITANCE OF CHILDREN**
In Islam, there are three categories of children: legal, biological and
those that are both legal and biological. By legal, we mean children that
result from a marriage approved by the Shari'ah. Thus for a man, only his
children that are both legal and biological are considered his children and by
extension, his heirs; while for a woman, the simple act of giving birth to a
child (biological) makes them (mother and child) rightful heirs of one
another. A few illustrations will elucidate this.
a) The Muslim children of a Muslim couple who married legally will
inherit from their parents and vice-versa. Supposing any of the
children happens to be a non-Muslim, he will neither inherit from
them nor will they inherit from him due to difference of religion
which is an impediment to inheritance.
At this point let’s spell out what difference of religion really mean.
Some scholars are of the view that each religion should be taken on its facevalue while others argue that there are two religions only: Islam and others.
Therefore, if we take a hypothetical family consisting of a Muslim father,
Christian mother and Jewish child for example, based on the first opinion,
none of them will inherit from one another, while the second view gives the
mother and the child the right to inherit from each other. How they do that is
left to them.
b) A Muslim man is permitted to marry a pious, reserved and religious
Christian or Jewish woman. The children that result from such a
marriage will inherit from the man and vice-versa if they are
Muslims. Assuming the children decide to follow the religion of their
mother, they will inherit from her only and vice-versa.
c) The children of a Muslim man who marries a woman that is neither a
Christian nor a Jew such as a Buddhist, a Zoroastrian or an atheist
will not inherit from him since they are not his legal children even
though they may be his biological children. Why? Such marriage is
not recognised by Shari’ah, hence it’s void. The children will inherit
from their mother only and vice-versa. And if they are Muslims, they
will also not inherit from her due to difference of religion.
d) A Muslim woman is not allowed to marry a non-Muslim man even if
he is a pious, reserved and religious Christian or Jew. If the marriage
takes place its void. But the children will inherit from her (and she
will inherit from them) because she is their biological mother IF
THEY ARE MUSLIMS, otherwise the difference of religion
condition will set in and bar them from inheriting from one another.


17


e) If a man and woman fornicates, (Allah forbids), and a child is born
as a result, whether or not they get married afterwards, the man is the
biological father but NOT the legal father of the child but the woman
is both the biological and legal mother. Hence such a child will
inherit from his mother ONLY and vice-versa.
This is evident from a Hadith narrated by ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr ibn al‘As who said: “The Prophet (peace be upon him) decided regarding one who
was treated as a member of a family after the death of his father, to whom he
was attributed when the heirs said he was one of them, that if he was the
child of a slave-woman whom the father owned when he had intercourse
with her, he was included among those who sought his inclusion, but
received none of the inheritance which was previously divided; he, however,
received his portion of the inheritance which had not already been divided;
but if the father to whom he was attributed had disowned him, he was not
joined to the heirs. If he was a child of a slave-woman whom the father did
not possess or of a free woman with whom he had illicit intercourse, he was
not joined to the heirs and did not inherit even if the one to whom he was
attributed is the one who claimed paternity, since he was a child of
fornication whether his mother was free or a slave.” **Abu Dawud Collection.**
The rulings in (c), (d) and (e) above do not imply that Islam
condones any of these acts. The perpetrators are to be duly punished
according to Shari’ah. We are interested in the inheritance of innocent
children that are products of these unfortunate incidences.
f) A child will in addition inherit from his mother only after _li’an_
(cursing for adultery) which happens when a man denies the
paternity of his wife’s pregnancy and they end up swearing and
cursing themselves. The Hadith of ‘Abdullah ibn ‘Amr ibn al-‘As
above confirms this: “…but if the father to whom he was attributed
had disowned him, he was not joined to the heirs…”
g) An adopted child will not inherit from his adoptive parents and viceversa due to lack of biological relationship between them. But they
can make a will in his/her favour which must not exceed 1/3 of their
estates.
h) **In-vitro fertilisation** : This is the process of fertilising an egg with
sperm in an artificial environment such as test-tube. A child
produced using this method is popularly called “test tube baby.”
The procedure involves stimulation of the woman with injected
medications to develop multiple follicles (egg-containing structures) in the
ovaries. Thereafter, a trans-vaginal ultrasound-guided procedure is performed
to remove the eggs from the follicles which are fertilized in the laboratory


18


with her partner’s sperm. The embryos are finally placed in the woman’s
uterus where they will hopefully implant and develop to result in a live birth.
According to Sheikh ‘Abd-Allaah al-Jibreen as cited by Sheikh
Muhammad Al-Munajjid, in-vitro fertilization is permissible in Islam if
certain conditions are fulfilled. They are:
i. That there is a real need for that. A delay of one or two years in
having children is not an excuse for the couple to pursue this or
similar methods. Rather they should be patient, for Allah may grant
them a way out soon without them doing anything that is _haram_ .
ii. The woman should not uncover her ‘ _awrah_ before men when there
are female staffs available.
iii. It is not permissible for the husband to masturbate; rather he may be
intimate with his wife without penetration, and produce semen in this
manner.
iv. The woman’s eggs and man’s sperm should not be kept in a freezer
for later use, or another appointment, and there should not be any
delay in placing them in the woman’s uterus. Rather that should be
done immediately without any delay, lest they be mixed with others
or be used for other people.
v. The sperm must come from the husband and the egg from the wife,
and be implanted in the wife’s uterus. Anything else is not
permissible at all.
vi. There should be complete trust in the doctors who are doing this
procedure.

As far as inheritance is concerned, the most important condition is
(v). This does not imply that others are not important as well. When (v) is
fulfilled, the child will inherit from both the father and mother and viceversa. However, if there happens to be a mix-up such that another man’s
sperm was used to fertilise the wife’s egg, the child will inherit from the
mother only. Conversely, if the husband’s sperm was used to fertilise another
woman’s egg, the child will inherit from the father only. In a situation
whereby the sperm and egg of others were used, there will be no inheritance
between the child and his “so-called” parents because they are no-more-than
adoptive parents. Note that even if the child develops in the wife’s womb, so
long as it’s not her egg, the biological connection that will necessitate
inheritance between them is missing.

**Son**
1. If he is the only heir, he inherits the whole estate of his deceased
father or mother.


19


2. When other heirs are inheriting along with him, he becomes a
residuary i.e. takes whatever remains after other heirs have gotten
their shares.
3. Two or more sons share equally the whole estate if they are the only
heirs.
4. Two or more sons share equally the residue of the estate when other
heirs are present.

**Daughter**
1. If a deceased has only one surviving daughter, she inherits half (½)
of the estate irrespective of whether she is the only heir or not.
2. Two or more daughters share equally two-third (2/3) of the estate
whether or not they are the only heirs.
One may be tempted to ask: what happens to the remaining ½ of the
estate when a daughter is the only heir or the remaining 1/3 of the estate
when two or more daughters are the only heirs? In other words, what is the
ruling when available heirs do not exhaust the estate? Jurists differed on this.
The various opinions are:
a) The residue goes to the _bait-ul-mal_ (public treasury) because no heir
should receive more than what Allah has prescribed for him/her.
b) The public treasury has been misused; therefore the heirs should
redistribute the residue among themselves based on the initial
sharing formula. This is technically called _Radd_ .
c) The residue should be given to the cognates (relations whose
connection to the deceased is traceable through the mother or female
line) who are traditionally non-heirs.
_Radd_ (reduction of base number) and inheritance of cognates are not
covered in this write-up, thus they are included in Further Reading.

**Son(s) and daughter(s)**
In a situation whereby the deceased leaves behind a combination of
sons and daughters in whatever form (i.e. son and daughter, son and
daughters, sons and daughter or sons and daughters), they share the whole
estate if they are the only heirs in a ratio of 2 to 1. Meaning that, a son is
given twice the share of a daughter. But if other heirs (that are not excluded
by them) are present, they [son(s) and daughter(s)] become residuaries in the
sense that they will share the left-over or residue after other heirs have
received their shares in the same ratio of 2 to 1. Allah says in the Qur'an:
“Allah commands you as regards your children’s (inheritance): to the
male, a portion equal to that of two females…” **Qur’an 4:11**


20


Non-Muslims and Muslims who do not understand their religion
argue that Islam is unjust to women in terms of inheritance. If not, why
should it grant the male twice the share of the female even though they are
children of the same parents? Answering this question, Hojjat al-Islam Mahdi
Hadavi Tehrani says, “… Islam’s position on inheritance is in reality to the
benefit of the woman. In the Age of Ignorance ( _Jahiliyya_ ), the daughters and
wives of the deceased were deprived of inheritance and all the wealth of the
deceased went to his sons. Islam, however, came and annulled the laws of the
ignorant times and made women amongst the inheritors of the deceased.
From its inception, Islam gave women independence in ownership and
monetary matters, this being a matter that has only but recently entered the
laws of European nations. Even though apparently the inheritance of a man is
double that of a woman, when we probe into the matter more thoroughly, we
find that the inheritance of a woman is two times that of a man. The
responsibilities that have been placed on the shoulders of men necessitates
that they spend half of their income on women. Any given man is obligated
to spend money on his spouse’s home, clothes, food, and other expenses,
while the cost of living of himself and his children are on his shoulders. This
responsibility of upkeep is to such an extent that even if a woman’s social
position necessitates her having a servant and she herself does not have the
means to pay for such a person, the salary of the aforementioned servant is
upon her husband. These responsibilities are on the shoulders of men,
whereas we see that women are exempted from paying any living expenses,
including their own – whether clothes or food. Therefore and in all
practicality, it is (the) woman who has more of a portion of wealth than (the)
man…”
“… Consider, for example, that the sum total of all the wealth of the
world is 30 billion pounds. Say that this wealth was distributed by means of
inheritance between men and women. From this amount of money, 20 billion
pounds went to men and 10 billion went to women. Since women do not
have to spend on themselves, they can save that 10 billion and become
partners with the men in the remaining 20 billion (since the portion of men is
spent on women and children). So, half of the portion of men, which is 10
billion pounds goes to women. When we add this amount to the portion that
the women saved from before, their sum total becomes 20 billion pounds…”
“…In the end, it is possible for us to say that if it is true that the
expenses of the woman are upon the shoulders of the man, then what use
does woman have in hoarding a large amount of wealth? We can answer by
saying that the dowry and inheritance of the woman is like a savings that is
for her future, in case she separates from her spouse or her spouse dies. It is
so she can lead a comfortable and respected life in case such events happen.


21


But the reason that the expenses of the woman is upon the man is so that she
can, without any sort of mental anxiety, raise good and pious children. In this
way the family, which is the cornerstone of society, will be filled with
warmth and love…”

**Grandson(s) and granddaughter(s)**
In the absence of a deceased's son(s) and daughter(s), his/her
grandson(s) and granddaughter(s) through son(s) will “jump” and inherit all
the rights and privileges of the substantive son(s) and daughter(s)
respectively. Therefore,
1. A grandson inherits the whole estate if he is the only heir or becomes
a residuary in the presence of other heirs.
2. Two or more grandsons share equally the whole estate if they are the
only heirs or share equally the residue if other heirs are present.
3. A granddaughter takes ½ of the estate, while two or more
granddaughters share equally 2/3 of the estate in the presence or
absence of other heirs.
4. A combination of grandson(s) and granddaughter(s) in whatever
form share the whole estate if they are the only heirs or share the
residue when other heirs exist in the ratio of 2 to 1, i.e. each
grandson takes twice the share of each granddaughter.

**Daughter(s) and granddaughter(s)**
Note that even though a granddaughter through a son acts like a
daughter in the absence of her father, this right is limited in the presence of
an actual daughter, because the maximum share of daughters, granddaughters
or a combination of daughters and granddaughters is 2/3 of the estate. Thus,
whenever daughter(s) and granddaughter(s) are inheriting together, the
former get their full shares while the latter distribute the residue of 2/3
equally if any. As a result,
1. One daughter, one granddaughter: Daughter gets ½; granddaughter
gets 1/6, making 2/3.
2. One daughter, two or more granddaughters: Daughter gets ½;
granddaughters share 1/6 equally.
3. More than one daughter, any number of granddaughters: Daughters
share 2/3 equally; granddaughters get nothing.
This is the application of rules 2 and 3 of exclusion i.e. a daughter
does not exclude grandchildren [children of her late brother(s)] and two or
more daughters exclude strictly granddaughters respectively.


22


**Daughter(s) and grandson(s)**
We know that sons and daughters share the whole estate or its
residue in a ratio of 2 to 1. In the absence of a son, the grandson through son
will “jump” and replace him but he does not have the same “power” as the
son if he is inheriting together with substantive daughter(s). He takes the
residue after the daughter(s) and other heirs if present have received their
shares. Thus,
1. One daughter, one grandson: Daughter receives ½; grandson receives
the residue. Residue here means ½ in the absence of other heirs or
whatever is left when other heirs are present and have gotten their
shares.
2. One daughter, more than one grandson: Daughter gets ½; grandsons
share residue equally.
3. More than one daughter, one grandson: Daughters share 2/3 equally;
grandson is given the residue.
4. Two or more daughters, two or more grandsons: Daughters receive
and share 2/3 proportionately; grandsons share the residue equally.

**Daughter(s), grandson(s) and granddaughter(s)**
As mentioned earlier, grandson(s) and granddaughter(s) divide the
whole estate or its residue in a ratio of 2 to 1. But when inheriting along with
substantive daughter(s), they will share the residue of the estate after the
daughter(s) and other heirs (if present) have received their shares. Hence,

1. A daughter, grandson(s), and granddaughter(s): Daughter receives ½;
grandson(s) and granddaughter(s) share the residue in a ratio of 2 to
1.
2. Two or more daughters, grandson(s) and granddaughter(s):
Daughters gets 2/3 which they will share equally; grandson(s) and
granddaughter(s) share the residue in a ratio of 2 to 1.
This is the application of rule 4 of exclusion which says that two or
more daughters do not exclude grandchildren comprising of at least a
grandson.

**Son(s) and grandchildren**
A son, sons or combination of son(s) and daughter(s) will inherit the
whole estate or the whole residue; therefore there will be no any leftover for
grandchildren to inherit from. This means that grandchildren get nothing.
Recall rule 1 of exclusion: a son excludes all grandchildren.


23


**INHERITANCE OF SPOUSES**
Inheritance of spouses depends on the presence or absence of:

  - Son(s)

  - Daughter(s)

  - Male descendants

  - Female descendants

Let’s call this group of heirs “beta.” Male descendants refer to
grandson through son, great-grandson through grandson through son, etc.,
while female descendants are granddaughter through son, greatgranddaughter through grandson through son, and so on. Remember that
granddaughter through daughter is a non-heir; great-granddaughter through
grandson through daughter is a non-heir; likewise great-granddaughter
through granddaughter through son is also a non-heir.

**Husband**
1. He receives half (½) of his late wife's estate if she has no surviving
member of beta with him, from a previous marriage or any
circumstance that legalises a child to inherit from his mother.
2. The husband is entitled to one-quarter (¼) of his late wife's estate if
she leaves behind at least one member of beta with him, from a
previous marriage or any circumstance that legalises a child to
inherit from his mother.
Supposing a woman has a child outside wedlock, gets married and
eventually passes on without a legitimate child, the husband will inherit ¼ of
her estate because the child is recognised by Shari’ah; though other factors
have to be considered like difference of religion and so on. We will like to
re-emphasise that sexual relations between unmarried individuals is
forbidden in Islam. As a result, both parties are to be punished as appropriate.
Nevertheless, the child that results is as clean and innocent as any legitimate
child.

**Wife**
1. The share of a wife from her late husband's estate if he has no
surviving member of beta with her or from a previous marriage is ¼.
Two, three or four wives are to share the ¼ equally.
2. If the husband has at least one surviving member of beta with the
wife or from a previous marriage, she receives one-eighth (1/8).
Two, three or four wives share the 1/8 equally.


24


**INHERITANCE OF PARENTS**
**Father**
1. He inherits the whole estate of his son or daughter if he is the only
heir.
2. He gets one-sixth (1/6) of the estate if the deceased leaves behind

      - Son(s)

      - Male descendant(s); or any of these combination of heirs:

      - Son(s) and daughter(s).

      - Daughter(s) and male descendant(s).

      - Male and female descendants.
3. The father inherits 1/6 of the estate PLUS the residue in the presence
of daughter(s), female descendants(s) or a combination of
daughter(s) and female descendant(s).
The rationale behind giving him the residue is that females do not
exhaust the estate, hence there is likely to be left-over after all heirs have
gotten their shares. But exclusive males or combination of males and females
as in (2) above inherit the whole residue, thus, the father receives just 1/6.

**Mother**
The mother’s share depends on the presence or absence of a set of
heirs we shall refer to as “gamma.” It comprises of:

  - Son(s)

  - Daughter(s)

  - Male descendant(s)

  - Female descendant(s)

  - Two or more full brothers or sisters

  - Two or more consanguine brothers or sisters

  - Two or more uterine brothers or sisters

  - A full brother and a full sister

  - A consanguine brother and a consanguine sister

  - A uterine brother and a uterine sister

1. The mother receives one-third (1/3) of her son’s/daughter’s estate if
he/she does not leave behind any member of gamma.
2. She gets 1/6 of the estate in the presence of any member of gamma.

By “any member” we mean at least one out of the ten classes listed
above. Note that one son, one daughter, one male descendant and one female
descendant each makes a class, but a single brother or a single sister of
whatever kind (full, consanguine or uterine) does not make a class.


25


Secondly, the mere presence of two or more brothers or sisters
relegates mother from 1/3 to 1/6 EVEN IF THEY ARE EXCLUDED. For
instance, a man passes on and leaves behind a wife, mother, father and two
full sisters. How will his estate be distributed? The wife receives ¼. Mother
should have gotten 1/3 but full sisters will partially exclude her to 1/6.
Incidentally, father excludes full sisters (rule 18), meaning that the remaining
heirs are mother and father. Now, since the sisters are not inheriting, will
mother be entitled to 1/3? No, she still gets 1/6 because the rule says “in the
presence of any member of gamma,” not “when any member of gamma is
inheriting along with her.” The residue then goes to the father.
Let’s assume the deceased leaves behind a brother and a sister, two
brothers or two sisters that are not of the same kind such as full and
consanguine, uterine and full or similar combination. Will his/her mother still
be excluded from 1/3 to 1/6? Definitely, even if one excludes the other.
Supposing a woman is survived by her husband, mother, full brother and
consanguine sister; ½ of the estate goes to the husband and mother receives
1/6 due to the presence of two siblings even though full brother excludes
consanguine sister. The residue is given to the full brother (to be discussed in
a moment).
3. In extraordinary cases called _‘Umariyyataini_, mother inherits 1/3 of
the residue. This shall be discussed in chapter eight (special cases).

**INHERITANCE OF GRANDPARENTS**
**Grandfather**
Call to mind that paternal grandfather is the one that inherits.
Maternal grandfather is a non-heir. In the absence of a deceased’s father,
his/her grandfather replaces the father. If the grandfather is also absent greatgrandfather takes the place of the father. In his absence also, the great-greatgrandfather if alive (but I wonder if he will) “jumps down” and inherits from
the deceased. Though according to Imam Malik, only two levels of
grandparents are entitled to inherit i.e. grandfather and great-grandfather, so
great-great-grandfather and his ascendants are non-heirs. But the difference
of opinion here is insignificant since the probability that great-greatgrandfather will inherit is very minimal because first, he has to be alive; and
secondly, father, grandfather and great-grandfather all have to be absent.
Consequently being considered as an heir or non-heir practically makes no
difference. Hence, like father, the grandfather
1. Inherits the whole estate if he is the only heir.
2. Receives 1/6 in the presence of son(s), male descendant(s) or a
combination of son(s) and daughter(s), male descendant(s) and
daughter(s) or male and female descendant(s).


26


3. Gets 1/6 + residue in the presence of daughter(s), female
descendant(s) or a combination of the two.

Recall that father totally excludes full and consanguine
brothers/sisters (rules 17 & 18) but grandfather do not have the ability to do
that according to the more popular view held by Jurists. Therefore in this
context, there are two possibilities:
1. Grandfather inheriting along with full or consanguine brothers/sisters
only, i.e. they are the only heirs, no other heir is present. Here,
grandfather has two choices:
a) 1/3 of the estate.
b) _Muqasama_ (sharing).
This means that he shares the estate together with full or consanguine
brothers/sisters as if he were one of them. Thus, he will be considered as a
full brother in the presence of full brothers, full sisters or a combination of
full brothers and sisters. Likewise, he will be counted as a consanguine
brother if consanguine brothers, consanguine sisters or a combination of
consanguine brothers and consanguine sisters are inheriting. In a situation
whereby a combination of full(s) and consanguine(s) are inheriting which is
only possible when the deceased leaves behind one full sister and one or
more consanguine sisters (to be discussed shortly), grandfather acts as a full
brother.
Grandfather has the free will to choose between these two options.
And naturally, he is expected to pick the one that gives him a larger share of
the estate depending on the circumstance. Details in chapter seven.

2. Inheritance of grandfather along with full or consanguine
brothers/sisters in the presence of other heirs.
These “other heirs” must not include father, son(s) or male
descendant(s) because father excludes both grandfather on one hand as well
as full and consanguine brothers/sisters on the other while son(s) and male
descendant(s) exclude full and consanguine brothers/sisters. In this scenario,
grandfather has three options:
a) 1/6 of the whole estate.
b) 1/3 of the residue (after other heirs have received their shares).
c) _Muqasama_ (sharing).
He picks whichever is the most favourable to him. Notice that
uterine brothers and sisters do not inherit together with grandfather because
he excludes them (rule 19).


27


**Grandmother**
In the absence of mother, either grandmother i.e. paternal, maternal or both
takes her place and inherit from the deceased. As a result,
1. Paternal grandmother gets 1/6 of the estate in the presence or
absence of other heirs.
2. Maternal grandmother receives 1/6 of the estate in the presence or
absence of other heirs.
3. Both paternal and maternal grandmothers share 1/6 equally in the
presence or absence of other heirs.
Let's shed more light on 1 and 2 above. When paternal grandmother
is the only surviving heir, she gets 1/6 of the estate. She receives the same
share (1/6) in the presence of other heirs which must not include maternal
grandmother, otherwise they are to share the 1/6 equally (3 above). Likewise
if maternal grandmother is the only heir, she is given 1/6 of the estate. When
she is inheriting along with other heirs not including paternal grandmother,
she receives the same 1/6. Consider the table below:

|Col1|Class 1|Class 2|Class 3|
|---|---|---|---|
||Mother|Father|Father|
|Level 1|Mat GM (a)|Pat GM (d)|Pat GF|
|Level 2|Mat GGM (b)|Pat GGM (e)|Pat GGM (g)|
|Level 3|Mat GGGM (c)|Pat GGGM (f)|Pat GGGM (h)|



Where Mat = Maternal
Pat = Paternal
GM = Grandmother
GF = Grandfather
GGM = Great-grandmother
GGGM = Great-great-grandmother
Using the table to expand rules 1, 2 and 3 above, when BOTH level
1 grandmothers are absent, a single surviving level 2 grandmother is given
1/6 of the estate. Two level 2 grandmothers share 1/6 equally and supposing
the 3 of them are present, they still share 1/6 equally. Similarly, in the
absence of all levels 1 and 2 grandmothers, one surviving level 3
grandmother inherits 1/6. Two of them share 1/6 equally and if all 3 are
alive, they are given 1/6 to share in equal proportions.
As stated earlier, Imam Malik believes that only two levels of
grandparents are rightful heirs, thus according to him, level 3 grandmothers
will not inherit, but this is contrary to the opinion of most Jurists who did not
specify a limit to the level of ascendants. Secondly, Malik considers paternal
great-grandmother through paternal grandfather (i.e. g) as a non-heir. This
also conflicts with the view of eminent companions like Zaid ibn Thabit,
‘Abdullahi ibn ‘Abbas and Jurists of later times including Abu Hanifa.


28


Nevertheless, examining the two opinions, we may conclude that practically
the divergence is negligible given that it is quite rare to see level 2
grandmothers inherit from a deceased not to talk of level 3 grandmothers. To
illustrate this, how many of us grew up to see our great-grandmothers alive?
And what is the probability that she will still be alive to witness our death
considering that our mothers and grandmothers have earlier passed on which
will enable her to take the place of our mothers and inherit from us? Maybe
zero point zero zero zero something (0.000...), an insignificant figure.
Therefore it is quite irrelevant whether paternal great-grandmother(s) and
level 3 grandmothers are listed among rightful heirs or not.
The general principle of exclusion is that heirs closer to the deceased
exclude those that are farther. That is why a son excludes grandson and
mother excludes grandmother for example. Now, among the grandmothers
the same principle applies. This brings us to...

**Rule 22a** : A nearer grandmother excludes a farther grandmother ON
EITHER SIDE.

Supposing in level 1 paternal grandmother passes on before the
deceased, the surviving maternal grandmother in level 1 will exclude all
grandmothers (both paternal and maternal) in level 2. That is what is meant
by “either side.” Hence she receives 1/6 of the estate. Similarly, in the
absence of maternal grandmother, paternal grandmother will do the same.
This is the opinion of Imams Abu Hanifa and Ahmad ibn Hanbal.

**Rule 22b** : A nearer maternal grandmother excludes farther grandmothers on
either side but a paternal grandmother DOES NOT exclude a farther maternal
grandmother.

This is the view of Imams Malik and As-Shafi’i. So as explained
above, in the absence of paternal grandmother, her maternal counterpart in
the same level will exclude both maternal and paternal grandmothers at a
higher level, thus she gets 1/6 of the estate. The difference here is that if
maternal grandmother in level 1 is absent, paternal grandmother in level 1 (d)
will exclude her own mother (e) but cannot exclude maternal grandmother in
level 2 (b). As a result, they (d and b) will share 1/6 equally. This is the limit
according to Malik because level 3 grandmothers are non-heirs. But if we are
to continue, assuming both level 1 grandmothers and maternal grandmother
in level 2 are absent, the two paternal grandmothers in level 2 (e and g) will
exclude their mothers (f and h) but will not exclude level 3 maternal


29


grandmother (c) if she is alive. Thus the three of them (e, g and c) will share
1/6 equally.

**INHERITANCE OF SIBLINGS**
**Uterine brother**
1. He receives 1/6 of the estate when alone or in the presence of other
heirs who do not exclude him.
Son, grandson (or his descendant), daughter, granddaughter through
a son, father and paternal grandfather (or his ascendant) EACH excludes
uterine brother (rule 19).
2. Two or more uterine brothers share 1/3 of the estate equally.

**Uterine sister**
1. She is given 1/6 of the estate if she is the only heir or in the presence
of other heirs who do not exclude her. Note that rule 19 also applies
to her.
2. Two or more uterine sisters share 1/3 of the estate equally.

**Uterine brother(s) and sister(s)**
A combination of uterine brother(s) and sister(s) share 1/3 of the
estate EQUALLY. The general rule of a male having double the share of a
female does not apply to them.

The uterine sibling we recall has the same mother but different father
with the deceased. Similarly, any individual that will inherit from his mother
only is considered a uterine. For instance, a woman ‘W’ has a son ‘A’
outside wedlock. (Islam does not encourage this. This is just a hypothetical
example IN CASE it happens; nevertheless, appropriate punishment applies).
She then marries ‘X’ and gave birth to a daughter ‘B’. Unfortunately, ‘X’
denies her paternity through _li’an._ The marriage did not work out, so they
divorced. Later, she marries ‘Y’ who already has a wife ‘Z’ with a son, ‘P’.
As the second wife, ‘W’ is blessed with two daughters, ‘C’ and ‘D’. So, what
happens if:
a) ‘Y’ dies?
His two wives, ‘Z’ and ‘W’ will share 1/8 equally while the children,
‘P’, ‘C’ and ‘D’ are to distribute the residue in a ration of 2 to 1 to 1 (2:1:1).
b) ‘W’ passes on when the status quo remains (i.e. ‘Y’ is absent)?
Her four children, ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’ and ‘D’ will share her estate in a
ratio of 2 to 1 to 1 to 1 (2:1:1:1).
c) ‘C’ dies (given that ‘Y’ and ‘W’ are absent)?


30


Her uterine brother and sister, ‘A’ and ‘B’ gets 1/3 of the estate
which they will share equally; her full sister ‘D’ is given ½ and the residue
goes to ‘P’, the consanguine brother (Inheritance of full sister and
consanguine brother shall be discussed shortly).
d) ‘P’ is absent?
His mother ‘Z’ inherits 1/3 and his surviving consanguine sister ‘D’
is given ½.
e) ‘A’ passes on?
‘B’ and ‘D’, his uterine sisters share 1/3 equally.

**Full brother**
1. He inherits the whole estate if he is the only heir
2. In the presence of other heirs who do not exclude him, he receives
the residue.
3. Two or more full brothers share the whole estate equally if they are
the only heirs or distribute the residue equally in the presence of
other heirs.
Son, grandson or his descendant and father each excludes full brother
(rules 15, 16, 17).

**Full sister**
Like a daughter, she is entitled to:
1. ½ of the estate when alone or in the presence of other heirs who do
not exclude her.
2. Two or more full sisters share 2/3 of the estate equally if they are the
only heirs or in the presence of other heirs who do not exclude them.
The same heirs that exclude full brother are the ones that exclude full
sister.
3. When a full sister is inheriting along with daughter(s),
granddaughter(s) through son(s) or a combination of daughter and
granddaughter(s) through son(s), she receives residue of the estate. In
this situation, she acts as a full brother and excludes whomsoever he
excludes.
4. Two or more full sisters inheriting along with daughter(s),
granddaughter(s) through son(s) or a combination of daughter and
granddaughter(s) through son(s), share the residue in equal
proportions.

Note that granddaughter(s) can only inherit along with a single
daughter in view of the fact that they cannot exhaust the 2/3 maximum share
of daughters. Hence, in the presence of two or more daughters who receive


31


2/3, granddaughter(s) will be excluded. That is why the combinations in 3
and 4 above are both that of (a single) daughter and granddaughter(s).

**Full brother(s) and full sister(s)**
1. A combination of full brother(s) and full sister(s) share the whole
estate in a ratio of 2 to 1 if they are the only heirs.
2. In the presence of other heirs who do not exclude them, they share
the residue in the same proportion (i.e. 2:1).

**Consanguine brother**
1. He inherits the whole estate if he is the only heir.
2. In the presence of other heirs who do not exclude him, he receives
the residue.
3. Two or more consanguine brothers share the whole estate equally if
they are alone or distribute the residue equally when other heirs who
do not exclude them are present.

Remember that any heir that excludes full brother automatically
excludes all other members of alpha which consanguine brother is a member.
Thus, son, grandson or his descendant and father each excludes consanguine
brother. In addition, full brother excludes consanguine brother (rule 8).

**Consanguine sister**
1. When she is the only heir or in the presence of other heirs who do
not exclude her, a single consanguine sister gets ½ of the estate while
two or more consanguine sisters inherit 2/3.
A consanguine sister is excluded by those who exclude consanguine
brother. She is also excluded by two or more full sisters (rule 6). One full
sister does not exclude her (rule 5).
2. When inheriting along with daughter(s), granddaughter(s) through
son(s) or a combination of daughter and granddaughter(s), a
consanguine sister is given the residue of the estate. Two or more
consanguine sisters share the residue equally.

**Consanguine brother(s) and consanguine sister(s)**
1. A combination of consanguine brother(s) and consanguine sister(s)
distribute the whole estate in a proportion of 2 to 1 when they are the
only heirs.
2. In the presence of other heirs who do not exclude them, they receive
the residue and share in a ratio of 2 to 1.


32


**Full sister(s), consanguine brother(s) and consanguine sister(s)**
In the presence or absence of other heirs, whenever they are not
excluded, the following apply:
1. One full sister, one consanguine brother: Full sister = ½;
consanguine brother = residue. Residue means ½ in the absence of
other heirs or the leftover after other heirs have received their shares.
2. One full sister, more than one consanguine brother: Full sister = ½;
consanguine brothers share the residue equally.
3. One full sister, one consanguine sister: Full sister = ½; consanguine
sister = 1/6.
4. One full sister, more than one consanguine sister: Full sister = ½;
consanguine sisters share 1/6 equally.
5. More than one full sister, one consanguine brother: Full sisters = 2/3;
consanguine brother = residue.
6. More than one full sister, more than one consanguine brother: Full
sisters = 2/3; consanguine brothers share the residue equally.
7. More than one full sister, any number of consanguine sisters: Full
sisters = 2/3; consanguine sisters get nothing.
8. One full sister, any number of consanguine brothers, any number of
consanguine sisters: Full sister = ½; consanguine brothers and sisters
share the residue in a ratio of 2 to 1.
9. More than one full sister, any number of consanguine brothers, any
number of consanguine sisters: Full sister = 2/3; consanguine
brothers and sisters share the residue in a 2 to 1 ratio.

**Full brother, consanguine brother(s), consanguine sister(s)**
Full brother excludes consanguine brother (rule 8) and by extension,
consanguine sister. So, in the presence of at least a full brother, whether he is
inheriting alone or along with full sister, consanguine brother(s) and sister(s)
receive nothing.


33


**CHAPTER FOUR**
**RESIDUARIES** _**(‘ASABAH)**_
These are heirs who:
1. Inherit the whole estate when they are the only heirs but in the
presence of other heirs who do not exclude them, they receive the
residue.
2. When they are the only heirs, they are given ½ or 2/3 of the estate,
but in the presence of some “specific” heirs, they
a) Share the residue with those “specific” heirs, or
b) Receive the residue after some “specific” heirs [different from those
in (a)] have gotten their shares of the estate.

In other words, there are 3 categories of residuaries:
i) Residuaries by themselves (i.e. those that satisfy 1 above).
ii) Residuaries by another (i.e. those that satisfy 2a above).
iii) Residuaries with another (i.e. those that satisfy 2b above).

**Residuaries by themselves (** _**‘Asabah bin-Nafs**_ **)**
These are:
a) Son
b) Grandson or his descendant
c) Father
d) Grandfather or his ascendant
e) Full brother
f) Consanguine brother
g) Full brother’s son or his descendant
h) Consanguine brother’s son or his descendant
i) Full paternal uncle
j) Half paternal uncle
k) Full paternal uncle’s son or his descendant
l) Half paternal uncle’s son or his descendant

We have looked at inheritance of (a) – (f). The same ruling applies to
other members of the set i.e. they inherit the whole estate or the residue when
other heirs who do not exclude them are present. Of course, son and father
cannot be excluded by any heir. Likewise, grandson (or his descendant) and
grandfather (or his ascendant) in the absence of son and father respectively
cannot be excluded.
Now, there seems to be a problem. If two heirs (of different classes)
listed above are present and both are eligible to inherit, will they share the
whole estate or residue among themselves? No, the heir occupying a higher


34


position in the hierarchy takes the residue, while the second one is given his
due share of the estate.
For example, a man leaves behind a wife, two sons and father. How
will his estate be distributed? The wife is given 1/8. This is clear. But the two
sons on one hand and the father on the other hand are both residuaries by
themselves. However, since the sons are above the father (i.e. they occupy
the 1 [st] position while the father comes 3 [rd] ), he (the father) is given 1/6 of the
estate while the two sons share the residue equally.
Supposing the surviving heirs were to be grandson, grandfather and
consanguine brother; what happens? We know that grandfather can inherit
along with a consanguine brother but grandson excludes the latter. As a
result, grandfather receives 1/6 while grandson gets the residue given that he
is above grandfather in hierarchy.

**Residuaries by another (** _**‘Asabah bil-ghair**_ **)**
This category has 4 heirs. They are:
a) Daughter
b) Granddaughter through son
c) Full sister
d) Consanguine sister
Each is entitled to ½ of the estate if alone while two or more share
2/3 of the estate equally if they are not excluded. Note that daughter cannot
be excluded. Now, if any of these listed heirs is inheriting along with her
male counterpart (i.e. son, grandson, full brother and consanguine brother
respectively), she is no longer given ½ or 2/3 as the case may be. She
becomes a residuary with the male. This has already been discussed in the
last chapter under the subheadings: son(s) and daughter(s), grandson(s) and
granddaughter(s), full brother(s) and full sister(s) as well as consanguine
brother(s) and consanguine sister(s).

**Residuaries with another (** _**‘Asabah ma’al ghair**_ **)**
These are full sister and consanguine sister. In the presence of
daughter(s), granddaughter(s) through son(s) or a combination of daughter
and granddaughter(s), full sister or consanguine sister (if not excluded) will
abandon her ½ (if only one) or 2/3 (if more than one) to become a residuary.
For instance, the heirs of a deceased are three daughters, two
granddaughters through son, one full sister and a grandmother. How will the
estate be allotted to them? The three daughters will share 2/3 equally,
grandmother gets 1/6 while full sister is given the residue. The two
granddaughters are excluded (rule 3).


35


Assuming a grandson is added to the heirs, daughters will still get
their 2/3, grandmother retains her 1/6, but now the granddaughters will be the
residuaries due to the presence of grandson. So, the three of them (i.e.
grandson and two granddaughters) will share the residue in a ratio of 2 to 1 to
1. This implies that full sister is excluded (rule 18).
Note that if the estate gets exhausted such that there is no left-over,
residuaries receive nothing. Exceptions to this rule are son and father who are
“basic heirs.” NO circumstance will arise in which the duo will become
“spectators.” In their absence, grandson (or his descendant) and grandfather
(or his ascendant) respectively replaces them to become basic heirs.


36


**CHAPTER FIVE**
**PARTIAL EXCLUSION**
There are two types of exclusion: total and partial. As defined earlier,
total exclusion means preventing a rightful heir from getting any share of a
deceased's estate due to the presence of another heir. We looked at 22 rules
of (total) exclusion. Now, partial exclusion is the reduction of an heir's share
of the estate due to the presence of another heir. Such reduction can be
a) From a higher share to a lower share.
b) From the whole estate to a share.
c) From a share to residue.
d) From whole estate to residue.
Thus, from our discussion so far, the following can be deduced:

**Partial exclusion (P.E) rule 1** : Son, daughter, male descendant and female
descendant each excludes husband from ½ to ¼.

**P.E rule 2** : Son, daughter, male descendant and female descendant each
excludes wife/wives from ¼ to 1/8.

**P.E rule 3** : Son, daughter, male descendant and female descendant each
excludes mother from 1/3 to 1/6.

**P.E rule 4** : Two or more brothers and/or sisters of the same kind or a
“combination of kinds” excludes mother from 1/3 to 1/6.

**P.E rule 5** : Son, male descendant or a combination of son and daughter,
daughter and male descendant as well as male and female descendants each
excludes father, grandfather or his ascendant from inheriting the whole estate
to 1/6.

**P.E rule 6** : Daughter, female descendant or a combination of daughter and
female descendant each excludes father, grandfather or his ascendant from
having the whole estate to 1/6 plus the residue (if any).

**P.E rule 7** : A (single) daughter excludes granddaughter from ½ to 1/6.

**P.E rule 8** : A daughter excludes two or more granddaughters from 2/3 to 1/6.
Remember that two or more daughters totally exclude strictly
granddaughters.


37


**P.E rule 9:** A daughter or female descendant excludes full or consanguine
sister from ½ to residue.

**P.E rule 10:** A daughter or female descendant excludes two or more full or
consanguine sisters from 2/3 to residue.

**P.E rule 11:** A full sister excludes consanguine sister from ½ to 1/6.

**P.E rule 12:** A full sister excludes two or more consanguine sisters from 2/3
to 1/6.

**P.E rule 13:** Father, mother, husband and wife each excludes son, male
descendant or a combination of male and female descendants from inheriting
the whole estate to residue.

**P.E rule 14:** Father, mother, husband and wife each do not exclude daughter
or female descendant from ½; likewise two or more daughters or female
descendants are not excluded from 2/3 by them unless the daughter(s) or
female descendant(s) is/are inheriting along son or male descendant
respectively in which case, they will become residuaries.


38


**CHAPTER SIX**
**INHERITANCE ARITHMETIC (“INHERITHMETIC”)**
The interesting aspect of inheritance is the arithmetic component.
We say arithmetic NOT mathematics because the operations involved are
addition, subtraction, multiplication and division only. So even those who
dislike mathematics I believe do not find these four basic operations tasking.
In any inheritance problem, the aim is to determine the MINIMUM
BASE NUMBER that will enable the estate to be distributed among the heirs
such that each will get his/her PORTION, WITHOUT a remainder or
decimal. To start with, let’s define some terms (as used in this text):
1. Share: - the fraction of the estate an heir is entitled to inherit such as
½, 1/8, 2/3 and so on.
2. Portion: - the number of segments of an estate an heir will receive.
This MUST NECESSARILY be a whole number, not a fraction or
number with decimal.
3. Base number ( _aslul mas-ala_ ): - as stated above, it’s a WHOLE
NUMBER that facilitates the distribution of the estate in accordance
with the shares of ALL the heirs and also generates the portion of
each.
A numeric example will clarify the concepts. Assuming a father
gives his 3 children, ‘A’, ‘B’ and ‘C’ £120 to share in proportions of 1/3, 1/6
and ½ respectively, how much will each child receive? Literally, the
question is saying that £120 should be divided into 3, then ‘A’ gets 1 part out
of the 3. Then £120 should be divided by 6, from which ‘B’ receives 1 part
out of 6. Similarly, ‘C’ is entitled to 1 out of 2 parts of £120. Therefore,
‘A’ receives £120 ÷ 3 = £40
‘B’ gets £120 ÷ 6 = £20
‘C’ is given £120 ÷ 2 = £60
To check whether we are correct, we add up what each child
receives: £40 + £20 + £60 = £120. This is how a deceased’s estate is
distributed. But practically, the estate is made up of houses, cars, clothes,
books, etc., and in most cases the total worth is not available. Therefore for
convenience, we determine a number which can be divided by each of the
DENOMINATORS of the shares under consideration. Note that every
‘fraction’ has a NUMERATOR (number on top of the slash) and a
denominator (number at the bottom of the slash). In this case, 1, 1 and 1 are
the numerators of 1/3, 1/6 and ½; while 3, 6 and 2 are the denominators.
Now, what number can be divided by 3, 6 and 2 WITHOUT a remainder or
decimal?
Let’s assume 3. So,
3 ÷ 3 = 1 3 ÷ 6 = 0.5 3 ÷ 2 = 1.5


39


Its clear 3 is not the number we are looking for because when divided by 6
and 2, the solutions have decimals. What if we consider 6 and 12?
6 ÷ 3 = 2 6 ÷ 6 = 1 6 ÷ 2 = 3
12 ÷ 3 = 4 12 ÷ 6 = 2 12 ÷ 2 = 6
Both 6 and 12 give us good solutions (i.e. with no decimals), so which one
do we choose? The minimum. Consequently, our base number in this
problem is 6. What this means is that the estate should be divided into 6
portions. ‘A’ takes 2 (1/3 of 6), ‘B’ gets 1 (1/6 of 6) and ‘C’ receives 3 (½ of
6). So, differentiating between SHARE and PORTION, the shares of ‘A’, ‘B’
and ‘C’ are 1/3, 1/6 and ½ respectively; while their portions are 2, 1 and 3
respectively. Hopefully the definition of portion as the “number of segments
of an estate an heir will receive” now makes more sense.
4. Number of heads: - this is the number of heirs IF they are of the
same gender. Hence, the number of heads of 2 sons is 2; the number
of heads of 9 granddaughters is 9. As simple as that. But if the heirs
are of mixed gender, a male has “2 heads” while a female has 1. This
is because a male gets double the share of a female. So, the number
of heads of 3 full brothers and 4 full sisters is 10; likewise the
number of heads of 12 sons and 5 daughters is 29.
5. Category: - a single heir makes a category if he/she inherits a share
of the estate alone while 2 or more heirs make a category if they are
to distribute a share of the estate among themselves. For instance, if
the surviving heirs of a deceased are wife and son, we have 2
categories of heirs since the wife has a share (1/8) and the son also
has a share (residue). Wife, father and 2 daughters; this is 3
categories given that the 2 daughters will share ½ of the estate
equally. Husband, 2 consanguine brothers, 4 consanguine sisters; this
is 2 categories. Consanguine brothers and sisters will share the
residue in a ratio of 2 to 1. Grandfather, 3 daughters, grandson and 5
granddaughters; how many categories? 3.

**Procedure of solving inheritance problems**
1. Determine the “actual” heirs.
Not all the 15 male and 9 female heirs we listed will inherit from a
deceased. Definitely, some will be excluded by others. As a result, the first
task is to know who excludes who. Supposing a woman is survived by her
husband, 2 daughters, 4 granddaughters, a full sister, 3 consanguine brothers,
2 full uncles, 5 full uncle’s sons and a full uncle’s daughter; only her
husband, 2 daughters and full sister are her “actual” heirs. Why? First, the
full uncle’s daughter is a non-heir. Husband and daughters are basic heirs.
They cannot be excluded. But since the daughters are two, they will exclude


40


granddaughters, then full sister will inherit as a “residuary by another,” in
which case, she acquires the rights and privileges of a full brother and as we
said earlier, “she excludes whomsoever he excludes,” i.e. consanguine
brothers, full uncles and their sons who are equally members of alpha (but
below him in hierarchy).
2. Spell out the share of each heir.
Here, the rules of partial exclusion come to play. The husband is
relegated from ½ to ¼ by the daughters, likewise they make full sister to get
residue (if any) as opposed to ½ of the estate if they were absent, yet their
share of 2/3 remains intact. We can see how influential children are.
3. Determine the base number.
Now, consider the shares at hand. In this example, ¼, 2/3 and
residue. We ask a simple question: what whole number is there whose onequarter and two-third are both whole numbers? Of course, there are so many
of them. So our job is to find out the least or minimum of them all. If we
randomly choose 20,
¼ × 20 = 5 2/3 × 20 = 13.33
Because 2/3 of 20 is not a whole number, 20 is not a solution. Let’s take 24.
¼ × 24 = 6 2/3 × 24 = 16
It seems 24 is what we are looking for. But is it the minimum? No, actually
the minimum base number for this problem is 12. Thus,
¼ × 12 = 3 2/3 × 12 = 8
How did we know that it’s 12? In other words, how do we determine the
most appropriate base number without trial and error? There are standard
rules for that which we shall be looking at shortly.
4. Generate the portion of EACH heir.
This is done by simply multiplying the base number by the share of
each heir. We have already started it in step 3 above. Therefore,
Husband receives 12 × ¼ = 3 portions
2 daughters get 12 × 2/3 = 8 portions
Full sister is given the residue which is 1 portion. That is, deduct 3 and 8
from 12, the reminder is 1 [12 – 3 – 8 = 1 or 12 – (3 + 8) = 1].
What we have done is to ascertain the number of portions each CATEGORY
of heir is entitled to; whereas the step requires us to find out the number of
portions EACH heir will receive. This is quite easy. When a category
consists of only one heir, he/she is given all the portions assigned to that
category. Hence, husband being the only one in his category takes all the 3
portions allocated to his category. Similarly, full sister inherits the one
portion assigned to her category.
But when a category has more than one heir, we divide the number
of portions that category is entitled to by the number of heads of heirs in it so


41


as to know how many portions each person gets. This means that since both
daughters make a category, we have to determine how many portions go to
daughter ‘A’ and how many daughter ‘B’ will receive. Their number of
heads is 2. Consequently,
8 portions ÷ 2 heads = 4 portions/head
Accordingly, each daughter is given 4 portions. So the deceased’s estate is
divided into 12 portions. Husband gets 3, each daughter inherits 4 and full
sister receives the remaining 1. As simple as that!
Now, what happens if a category is made up of male and female
heirs who are to distribute a share among themselves such as sons and
daughters? Let’s answer the question using this quick example. A man dies
leaving behind a wife, 3 sons and a daughter, how will his estate be shared
among them?
Henceforth, we shall not bother ourselves mentioning ALL the
relatives or heirs a deceased leaves behind. Only the “actual” heirs will be
stated. Our assumption is that any heir not mentioned is either absent or have
been excluded by at least one of those under consideration. In this instance,
the man may actually have uncles, brothers, sisters, aunts, grandchildren and
so on. But his children especially the sons have excluded all of them.
Observe that son cannot exclude father and mother. Since they were not
listed among the heirs, we suppose that they died before him, i.e. they are
absent.
Step 2: The wife should have received ¼ of the estate but the
children will partially exclude her to 1/8. Again we assume that by now, the
reader is conversant with the rules of partial exclusion. So we shall not be
stating how we arrive at the shares of each heir. Anyway, the 3 sons and
daughter will share the residue in a ratio of 2 to 2 to 2 to 1 respectively.
Step 3: The base number is 8. How we got this? Details shortly.
Step 4: Mother receives 8 × 1/8 = 1 portion
Children are given the remaining 7 portions (8 – 1 = 7).
Number of heads of 3 boys and 1 daughter = 7
Therefore, 7 portions ÷ 7 heads = 1 portion/head
Recall that males have “2 heads” while females have 1. Hence,
Son ‘A’: 2 heads × 1 portion/head = 2 portions
Son ‘B’: 2 heads × 1 portion/head = 2 portions
Son ‘C’: 2 heads × 1 portion/head = 2 portions
Daughter: 1 head × 1 portion/head = 1 portion
The same principle applies when we have combination of
grandson(s) and granddaughter(s), full brother(s) and full sister(s),
consanguine brother(s) and consanguine sister(s), etc.


42


Sometimes, the heirs that make up a category CANNOT share their
portion of the estate because:
a) It is NOT ENOUGH to go round, or
b) After all heirs have received their portions, there is an EXTRA
which will not be sufficient to go round.
For example, if 2 sons and 3 daughters are to share 6 portions of an estate,
Each son is to get 2 portions = 4 portions
Each daughter is entitled to 1 portion = 3 portions
Total number of portions required = 7, which is the same as their number of
heads.
It is clear that the children cannot share 6 portions because if we go
ahead, we will run into fractions or numbers with decimals which is not
acceptable in inheritance. And as long as we want to stick with whole
numbers, someone will be short-changed; either one of the daughters gets
nothing or one of the sons is given 1 portion instead of 2. This is also not
allowed EVEN IF the heirs by consensus accepts it or one of the heirs agrees
to receive less or nothing. Remember that inheritance distribution is an act of
worship and has to be done according to the dictates of Shari’ah.
Similarly, if the 2 sons and 3 daughters were to share 10 portions of
the estate, all the children will get their complete portions but there will be
extra 3 which will not go round. Had it been the extra were 7, they will
redistribute it again among themselves so that each son will receive 4
portions (original 2 plus extra 2 redistributed), while each daughter gets 2.
In both instances (i.e. when number of portions is not enough or
when there is an extra), the four steps enumerated above are insufficient.
Additional steps are required to obtain a new base number. This brings us to
the LEVELS OF INHERITANCE PROBLEMS.
Level 1: All categories of heirs are able to share their portions of the estate.
Level 2: One or two categories of heirs cannot share their portions of the
estate.
Level 3: More than two categories of heirs cannot share their portions of the
estate.
All inheritance problems will necessary fall within these three levels.
The beauty of it is that each level has distinct rules regarding how to obtain
the base number. So, if one is able to determine what level a problem belongs
to, the next thing is simply to apply the appropriate rule(s) and the portion of
each heir will emerge.


43


**LEVEL ONE**
**Level 1(a): One category of heir with no fixed share**
**Rule A:** The number of heads of heirs is the base number

|1|Col2|
|---|---|
|Heirs|5 Consanguine brothers, 2 Consanguine sisters|
|Share|Whole estate|
|Base number|12|
|Portions|Each brother = 2; each sister = 1|



The estate is divided into 12 portions (i.e. the base number). Each
male is given 2 portions because he has “2 heads,” whereas each female
receives 1 portion since she has “1 head.” Observe that step 4 in which the
base number is multiplied by the share of the heir to generate his/her portion
is not applicable here in view of the fact that the heirs have no specific
shares. That necessitated the use of their number of heads.
Example 2

|Heirs|3 sons|
|---|---|
|Share|Whole estate|
|Base number|6|
|Portions|Each son = 2|



This is quite straight-forward. Just one thing. The principle that males have
“2 heads” while females have 1 may not be relevant if the heirs are all male;
in which case they can be considered as having “1 head” each so as to reduce
the base number and by extension the number of portions the estate is
divided into. Recall the definition of number of heads as, “the number of
heirs if they are of the same gender.” As a result, the same problem can be
solved like this;

|Heirs|3 sons|
|---|---|
|Share|Whole estate|
|Base number|3|
|Portions|Each son = 1|



**Level 1(b): One category of heir with a fixed share**
**Rule B:** Base number is the denominator of the share
Example 3

|Heirs|2 daughters|
|---|---|
|Share|2/3|
|Base number|3|
|Portions|Each daughter = 1|



Estate is divided into 3 portions. Each daughter is given 1; equivalent to her
number of head. There will be 1 extra portion.


44


Example 4

|Heirs|1 full sister|
|---|---|
|Share|½|
|Base number|2|
|Portions|1|



Similar to example 3, estate is divided into 2 portions. Full sister takes 1
corresponding to her number of head. There is 1 extra portion.
Question: What happens to the extra? This has being answered
earlier. There are 3 opinions of Jurists regarding this.
a) The extra goes to the _bait-ul-mal_ (public treasury).
b) The heirs should redistribute the extra.
c) It should be given to the cognates (relations whose connection to the
deceased is traceable through the mother or female line) who are
traditionally non-heirs.

**Level 1(c): Two categories of heirs with one having a fixed share**
**Rule C:** Base number is the denominator of share of the category with a

|are e 5|Col2|Col3|
|---|---|---|
|Heirs|Wife|1 Son; 1 Daughter|
|Shares|¼|Residue|
|Base number|4|4|
|Portions|1|Son = 2; Daughter = 1|



Considering step 4 for both categories of heirs,
Wife: 4 × ¼ = 1 portion
Son and daughter: Residue i.e. 4 – 1 = 3 portions
Son has “2 heads” hence inherits 2 portions while daughter has “1 head”
therefore is given 1 portion.

|6|Col2|Col3|
|---|---|---|
|Heirs|Mother|2 Full brothers; 1 Full sister|
|Shares|1/6|Residue|
|Base number|6|6|
|Portions|1|Each full brother = 2; full sister = 1|



Mother: 6 × 1/6 = 1 portion
2 Full brothers and 1 full sister: Residue i.e. 6 – 1 = 5 portions
The 5 portions are distributed among the full brothers and full sister in a ratio
of 2 to 2 to 1 respectively.

**LOWEST COMMON MULTIPLE (LCM)**
This section is meant to review the same LCM we were taught in
elementary Mathematics. You may wish to skip it if you think that you do
not need it. For those of us that want to refresh our memories, the three
concepts: lowest, common and multiple will be easier understood if
explained in reverse order, i.e. multiple, common, lowest.
**Multiple**
Remember the times table?
2 × 1 = 2 3 × 1 = 3 4 × 1 = 4
2 × 2 = 4 3 × 2 = 6 4 × 2 = 8
2 × 3 = 6 3 × 3 = 9 4 × 3 = 12
2 × 4 = 8 3 × 4 = 12 4 × 4 = 16
2 × 5 = 10 3 × 5 = 15 4 × 5 = 20
Now, the solutions under a particular number are its multiples. So,
Multiples of 2 = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, …
Multiples of 3 = 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, …
Multiples of 4 = 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, …
**Common**
When considering the multiples of two numbers, the ones that appear
for both are the “common multiples.” For instance,
Common multiples of 2 and 3 = 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, …
Common multiples of 2 and 4 = 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, …
This also applies for more than two numbers. Hence,
Common multiples of 2, 3 and 4 = 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, …
**Lowest**
Of all the common multiples, which one is the smallest, minimum,
least? Therefore,
Lowest common multiple of 2 and 3 = 6
LCM of 2 and 4 = 4
LCM of 2, 3 and 4 = 12
But, does that mean that to determine the LCM of 2, 3 or 4 numbers, all their
multiples have to be listed, then the common ones are identified before
picking the lowest? Certainly not. There are standard ways of finding the
LCM. However, the method or technique to use depends on the
RELATIONSHIP between the numbers under consideration. Generally,
numbers are related as follows:
i) Same e.g. 2 and 2, 3 and 3, 4 and 4.
ii) One being a multiple of the other e.g. 2 and 4, 3 and 6, 4 and 8.
iii) Neither (i) nor (ii) above e.g. 2 and 3, 4 and 5, 7 and 10.
When numbers are the same, their LCM is simply the number itself.
For example, what is the LCM of 5 and 5?


46


Multiples of 5 = 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, …
Multiples of second 5 = 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, …
Common multiples of both = 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, …
As a result, the LCM of 5 and 5 = 5.
In the field of inheritance, this is called _TAMATHUL_ i.e. the same.
If two numbers are related such that one is a multiple of the other,
their LCM is the higher number. For instance, what is the LCM of 3 and 6?
Multiples of 3 = 3, **6**, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, …
Multiples of 6 = 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, …
Common multiples of 3 and 6 = 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, …
Thus, the LCM of 3 and 6 = 6.
Notice that 6 is a multiple of 3, which is why the common multiples of 3 and
6 are actually the multiples of 6! Hence, their LCM is simply the LCM of 6
since it is the higher number. Similarly, the LCM of 3 and 21 is 21 and the
LCM of 6 and 42 is 42. This phenomenon is referred to as _TADAKHUL_,
meaning multiple.
In a situation whereby the numbers under consideration are
“neither,” i.e. are not the same and one is not a multiple of the other, the
easiest way to determine their LCM is to MULTIPLY them. Example, what
is the LCM of 2 and 3?
Multiples of 2 = 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, …
Multiples of 3 = 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, …
Common multiples of 2 and 3 = 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, …
So, LCM of 2 and 3 = 6.
Likewise, LCM of 4 and 5 is 20 and LCM of 7 and 12 is 84. This is called
_TABAYIN_ in inheritance literature. I translate it as “parallel.” The fourth
relationship between numbers shall be unveiled in due course. Meanwhile,
knowledge of these relationships is the SECRET of determining the base
number and by implication the whole of inheritance arithmetic! That is why a
lot of space is being devoted to explain these basics.
Let’s complicate the problem. How do we find the LCM of 3 or
more numbers? First, pick any 2 numbers and find their LCM. Call this LCM
‘X’. Next, pick a 3 [rd] number. Determine the LCM of this 3 [rd] number and ‘X’.
Call this new LCM ‘Y’. Then find the LCM between ‘Y’ and the 4 [th] number.
And the process continues. The final LCM is the LCM of all the numbers.
Example, what is the LCM of 2, 5 and 10? Considering the first two numbers
2 and 5, they are parallel, so multiply them to get the LCM. It’s 10. But this
solution, 10 and the 3 [rd] number, 10 are the same. And the LCM of similar
numbers is that number. Thus, the LCM of 2, 5 and 10 is 10.
Alternatively, if 2 and 10 were considered first, 10 is a multiple of 2
so the higher number, 10 is chosen as the LCM. Incidentally, the solution, 10


47


is also a multiple of the 3 [rd] number, 5. As a result the higher number, 10 is
picked and that is the LCM of the 3 numbers. The LCM of the 3 numbers
will equally be 10 if 5 and 10 are taken first. That is the beauty of
Mathematics. It does not lie!
These methods of finding LCM are also applicable to fractions. But
in their case, only the DENOMINATORS are considered. For instance,
LCM of 2/3 and 1/3 = 3 Both denominators are the same.
LCM of ½ and 1/6 = 6 6 is a multiple of 2, so pick the higher one.
LCM of ¼ and 1/7 = 28 4 and 7 are parallel, so multiply them.

**Level 1(d): Two or more categories of heirs with at least two having**
**fixed shares**
**Rule D:** If the denominators of the shares are the same, that is the base
number.
Example 7

|Heirs|Husband|Sister|
|---|---|---|
|Shares|½|½|
|Base number|2|2|
|Portions|1|1|



Estate is divided into 2 portions. Each heir inherits 1.

|Heirs|Grandmother|Uterine sister|Consanguine brother|
|Shares|1/6|1/6|Residue|

Base number = 6; that is clear.
Grandmother: 6 × 1/6 = 1 portion
Uterine sister: 6 × 1/6 = 1 portion
Consanguine brother: 6 – 1 – 1 = 4 portions

**Rule E:** When the denominator of one share is a multiple of the denominator
of the other share, the higher one is the base number
Example 9

|Heirs|Wife|Daughter|Half uncle|

|Shares|1/8|½|Residue|
|Base number|8|8|8|
|Portions|1|4|3|



Wife: 8 × 1/8 = 1 portion

Base number is the LCM of 3, 6 and 6 = 6.
2 full sisters: 6 × 2/3 = 4 portions. Each full sister gets 2 portions.
Uterine brother: 6 × 1/6 = 1 portion

2 daughters: 24 × 2/3 = 16 portions. Each daughter receives 8 portions.
Wife: 24 × 1/8 = 3 portions
Full uncle’s son: 24 – 16 – 3 = 5 portions or 24 – (16 + 3) = 5 portions

|Portions|3|4|5|


Wife: 12 × ¼ = 3 portions
1 uterine brother and 1 uterine sister: 12 × 1/3 = 4 portions. Each is given 2
portions because two or more uterines share 1/3 of the estate equally
irrespective of whether they are males or females.
1 consanguine brother and 3 consanguine sisters: 12 – (3 + 4) = 5 portions.
Consanguine brother gets 2 portions while each consanguine sister inherits 1
portion.

**Exercise 1**
The heirs of a deceased are two daughters, mother, father, brother and sister.
How will the estate be allotted to them?

**HIGHEST COMMON FACTOR (HCF)**
Given any number, its factors are numbers which can divide it and
the solution is a whole number. For example: What are the factors of 10? To
answer this, 10 is divided by all numbers between 1 and 10.
10 ÷ **1** = 10 10 ÷ 6 = 1.67
10 ÷ **2** = 5 10 ÷ 7 = 1.43
10 ÷ 3 = 3.33 10 ÷ 8 = 1.25
10 ÷ 4 = 2.5 10 ÷ 9 = 1.11
10 ÷ **5** = 2 10 ÷ **10** = 1
Therefore, the factors of 10 = 1, 2, 5 and 10
Using this approach, the factors of 6 will be 1, 2, 3 and 6; because if
6 is divided by 4 and 5, the answers will not be whole numbers. That is to say
the common factors of 10 and 6 are 1 and 2. And the Highest Common
Factor (HCF) of 10 and 6 is 2. But the following should be noted:
i) 1 is a factor of any number
ii) All numbers are factors of themselves
iii) The factor of a number CANNOT be greater than the number itself.
Another example. What is the HCF of 12 and 15?
Factors of 12 = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12
Factors of 15 = 1, 3, 5 and 15
Common factors of 12 and 15 = 1 and 3
HCF of 12 and 15 = 3

**Prime Numbers**
These are numbers whose factors are ONLY 1 and themselves. If
they are divided by any other number, the answer will not be a whole
number. An example is 11.
11 ÷ 1 = 11 11 ÷ 5 = 2.2 11 ÷ 9 = 1.22
11 ÷ 2 = 5.5 11 ÷ 6 = 1.83 11 ÷ 10 = 1.1
11 ÷ 3 = 3.67 11 ÷ 7 = 1.57 11 ÷ 11 = 1
11 ÷ 4 = 2.75 11 ÷ 8 = 1.38
Since only 1 and 11 are the factors of 11, it is said to be a prime number.
Others are 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 23, …
Now, the HCF of two numbers one of which is a prime number is 1.
For instance, what is the HCF of 5 and 6?
Factors of 5 = 1 and 5
Factors of 6 = 1, 2, 3 and 6
Common factor of 5 and 6 = 1
HCF of 5 and 6 = 1
The rule also applies if both numbers are prime numbers. Example, what is
the HCF of 13 and 17?


50


Factors of 13 = 1 and 13
Factors of 17 = 1 and 17
Common factor of 13 and 17 = 1
HCF of 13 and 17 = 1
Observe that whenever the common factor of a set of numbers is 1,
the HCF of the numbers is also 1. This is normal Mathematics. But the rules
of Inheritance Arithmetic which I call “inherithmetic” sometimes violate well
known Mathematical principles. The most important of these violations is
that inherithmetic DOES NOT recognise 1 as a common factor. So, revisiting
our earlier solutions,
Common factor of 10 and 6 = 2
Common factor of 12 and 15 = 3
Common factor of 5 and 6 = No common factor!
Common factor of 13 and 17 = No common factor!
In order to differentiate between common factor of Mathematics
which incorporates 1 and the common factor of inherithmetic that does not
recognise 1, the latter will be renamed “Common Divisor” and henceforth,
that is what will be used. As the name implies, common divisor is a number
OTHER THAN 1, that can divide the numbers under consideration and the
answers will be whole numbers. In case there exist 2 or more common
divisors, the “Highest Common Divisor (HCD)” is used.
Recall that two or more numbers are parallel when they are not the
same and one is not a multiple of the other. Also, the LCM of parallel
numbers is gotten by simply multiplying them. At this point, this method of
finding the LCM of parallel numbers will be modified. The modification
does not affect what has being discussed earlier. The new rule is: if two
parallel numbers ‘A’ and ‘B’ HAVE A COMMON DIVISOR, their LCM is
determined by DIVIDING ‘A’ with the common divisor, then use the
solution to MULTIPLY ‘B’. Alternatively, divide ‘B’ by the common divisor
and multiply the solution with ‘A’. Both approaches will give the same
answer. But when the parallel numbers HAVE NO COMMON DIVISOR,
the previous rule of multiplying them gives the LCM.
Question: What is the LCM of 3 and 7?
Common divisor of 3 and 7 = None
LCM of 3 and 7 = 3 × 7 = 21

Question: What is the LCM of 6 and 8?
Common divisor of 6 and 8 = 2
LCM of 6 and 8 = 6 ÷ 2 = 3 × 8 = 24  or  8 ÷ 2 = 4 × 6 = 24
Notice that if the previous rule were applied, the LCM should have been 6 ×
8 = 48; which is not quite correct. Let’s prove it.


51


Multiples of 6 = 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, …
Multiples of 8 = 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, 72, 80, …
Common multiples of 6 and 8 = 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, …
LCM of 6 and 8 = 24
Therefore, it can be established that not all parallel numbers are
actually parallel. Some tend to “converge” at a point. This phenomenon is
called _TAWAFUQ_, which I translate as Converge. In summary, the 4
relationships between numbers are:
i) Same ( _Tamathul_ )
ii) One being a multiple of the other ( _Tadakhul_ )
iii) Parallel – neither (i) nor (ii) and have no common divisor ( _Tabayin_ )
iv) Converge – neither (i) nor (ii) but have a common divisor ( _Tawafuq_ )
The reader is encouraged to take some time and arbitrarily white down any
two numbers then consider the relationship between them. It MUST
NECESSARILY be one of these four!

**Rule G:** When there is a common divisor between the denominators of the
shares, divide one by the common divisor and multiply the solution with the
other. The result is the base number.

Common divisor of 4 and 6 = 2
LCM of 4 and 6 = 4 ÷ 2 = 2 × 6 = 12  or  6 ÷ 2 = 3 × 4 = 12
Husband: 12 × ¼ = 3 portions
Grandmother: 12 × 1/6 = 2 portions
Son: 12 – 3 – 2 = 7 portions  or  12 – (3 + 2) = 7 portions

**INCREMENT OF BASE NUMBER** _**(‘AWL)**_
Earlier, we made mention of a father who gave his three children,
‘A’, ‘B’ and ‘C’ £120 to share in proportions of 1/3, 1/6 and ½ respectively.
Of course the LCM of 3, 6 and 2 is 6 which is also the base number; so £120
is divided into 6 portions.
‘A’: 6 × 1/3 = 2 portions
‘B’: 6 × 1/6 = 1 portion
‘C’: 6 × ½ = 3 portions
Sum of the portions = 2 + 1 + 3 = 6 portions; equivalent to the base number.
This is an example of a perfect distribution of an estate. However, supposing
the share of ‘C’ was 2/3, what happens? Their shares will then be 1/3, 1/6


52


and 2/3. The base number is still 6. But ‘C’ shall be entitled to 4 portions!
How?
‘C’: 6 × 2/3 = 4 portions
New sum of portions = 2 + 1 + 4 = 7 portions; which is greater than the base
number. What is the implication of this? Let’s examine it critically.
1 portion of £120 = £120 ÷ 6 = £20
‘A’ has 2 portions = £20 × 2 = £40
‘B’ has 1 portion = £20 × 1 = £20
‘C’ has 4 portions = £20 × 4 = £80
Summation = £40 + £20 + £80 = £140
Something must be wrong somewhere. The possibilities are:
i) The share of at least one of the children (i.e. 1/3, 1/6 or 2/3) is
wrong.
ii) The father erroneously gave them £120 instead of £140.
But in inheritance, none of these assumptions hold water. That is to say, the
shares of the children which denote the shares of heirs are correct. Also, the
amount the father gave; a figurative expression meaning the total asset of a
deceased is equally correct. Actually, this is a practical example whereby a
deceased leaves behind 2 uterine brothers, mother and 2 full sisters with a
total estate worth £120. To solve this problem, the base number is increased
from 6 to 7. This procedure is called Increment of Base Number. Therefore,
1 portion of £120 = £120 ÷ 7 = £17.14
‘A’ (2 Uterine brothers): £17.14 × 2 portions = £34.28
‘B’ (Mother): £17.14 × 1 portion = £17.14
‘C’ (2 Full sisters): £17.14 × 4 portions = £68.56
Summation = £34.28 + £17.14 + £68.56 = £119.98; approximately £120
Note that the amount each category of heir finally gets reduces in proportion
to its share. For instance, full sisters with the largest share have the highest

|uction. Thus,|Col2|Col3|Col4|
|---|---|---|---|
|Heirs|Original value of<br>portion|New value of<br>portion|Reduction|
|Uterine brothers|£40|£34.28|£5.72|
|Mother|£20|£17.14|£2.86|
|Full sisters|£80|£68.56|£11.44|



**Rule H:** If the result of summation of portions is greater than the base
number, such result becomes the base number. Yet, each heir retains his/her
number of portions originally allotted to him/her. Though, their shares will
reduce proportionately.

Husband: 6 × ½ = 3 portions
Full sister: 6 × ½ = 3 portions
Summation = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 portions; which is greater than the base number.
Hence, the base number is increased to 8.

2 consanguine sisters: 12 × 2/3 = 8 portions; each one gets 4 portions
2 uterine sisters: 12 × 1/3 = 4 portions; each one gets 2 portions
Total = 3 + 8 + 4 = 15 portions; which is greater than the base number.
Accordingly, the base number is increased to 15.

|Increased base number|27|27|27|27|



Observe that the father’s share suppose to be “1/6 + residue,” but the base
number, 24, is not even enough to share among the heirs, so there will be no
question of any residue.
This is a celebrated case of inheritance called _MIMBARIYYA_ for the
reason that Caliph ‘Ali solved it while delivering a sermon on the _mimbar_
(i.e. pulpit) in a Mosque at Kufa, in present day Iraq. He was asked what a
wife’s share will be if the surviving heirs of a deceased are wife, both parents
and 2 daughters. There and then, he answered, “The wife’s 1/8 becomes 1/9.”
Let’s examine this.
Using the original base number, wife has 24 × 1/8 = 3 portions
With increment of base number and considering ‘Ali’s response, wife gets 27
× 1/9 = 3 portions


54


This further buttresses the point that whenever the base number is increased,
an heir’s share reduces (in this case from 1/8 to 1/9) but his/her number of
portions remains intact.
IMPORTANT: Increment of base number only applies when ALL
categories of heirs have fixed shares. If residuaries are present, increment
will not be necessary because they are given whatever remains. Residuaries
cannot force those with fixed heirs to reduce their shares to enable them have
something. However, in exceptional cases whereby increment has to be done
and a residuary is among the heirs, he/she most likely receives nothing. For
example,

|Heirs|Husband|Mother|2 daughters|Full uncle|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Shares|¼|1/6|2/3|Residue|
|Base number|12|12|12|12|
|Portions|3|2|8|0|
|New base number|13|13|13|13|



Notice that even though full uncle is an heir, despite the increment, he still
gets nothing.

**LEVEL 2**
**Level 2(a): One category of heirs cannot share its portion of the estate**
**Rule I:** Let the number of heads of the category of heirs that cannot share its
portion be ‘X’, and the number of portions allotted to the category be ‘Y’. If
‘X’ and ‘Y’ are parallel, multiply the number of heads of the heirs by the
base number to generate a new base number.

|Heirs|Mother|2 Sons; 2 Daughters|

Rule C was used to arrive at 6, the base number. Henceforth, this
will not be stated. It is assumed that the reader is conversant with all the rules
of Level 1. Levels 2 and 3 are advanced stages of Level 1. So, given any
inheritance problem, one has to use the appropriate Level 1 rule to get the
base number and the number of portions each category of heir is entitled to.
If ALL categories are able to share their portions of the estate, that is a Level
1 problem and the task is completed. However, when 1 or 2 categories of
heirs are NOT able to share their portions of the estate, we have a Level 2
problem at hand. A new base number is generated using the suitable Level 2
rule. Finally, new portions are calculated for each category of heir. Thus,
Mother: 6 × 1/6 = 1 portion


55


2 sons and 2 daughters: Residue i.e. 6 – 1 = 5 portions
Number of heads of 2 sons and 2 daughters = 6
This problem has two categories of heirs: mother on one hand and 2
sons and 2 daughters on the other. Mother inherits 1 portion of the estate. She
has no problem. But 2 sons and 2 daughters cannot share 5 portions because
their number of heads is 6 (2 sons = 4 heads; 2 daughters = 2 heads). So, they
require 6 portions, NOT 5 portions as allocated to them. For this reason, we
conclude that they CANNOT SHARE THEIR PORTION of the estate. Note
that _‘awl_ (increment of base number) is not applicable here because
residuaries are present and they are entitled to some portion of the estate. To
solve this, consider the number of heads of the category that cannot share its
portion (i.e. 6) and its number of portions (i.e. 5). 6 and 5 are parallel since
they have no common divisor. In other words, no existing number can divide
6 and equally divide 5 without a remainder. At this point it will be nice to
show WHY one (1) is not regarded as a common divisor, given that it is the
only number that can divide 6 and 5 without remainder.
6 ÷ 1 = 6 5 ÷ 1 = 5
The results of both divisions are the same as the original problem. What have
we done? Nothing. Any progress made towards solving our problem? No.
So, it’s evident that inherithmetic was right not to consider 1 as a common
divisor. Now, applying the rule,
‘X’ = Number of heads = 6
‘Y’ = Base number = 6
‘X’ multiplied by ‘Y’ gives the new base number. Accordingly,
New base number = 6 × 6 = 36
Step 4 will then be repeated (using the new base number)
Mother: 36 × 1/6 = 6 portions
2 sons and 2 daughters: Residue i.e. 36 – 6 = 30 portions
This is shared among the children such that sons get twice the share of
daughters. The easiest way to do this is to divide the 30 portions by their
number of heads. Therefore,
30 portions ÷ 6 heads = 5 portions/head
Each son is given 5 portions/head × 2 heads = 10 portions
Each daughter inherits 5 portions/head × 1 head = 5 portions
The table now becomes

|Heirs|Mother|2 Sons; 2 Daughters|
|---|---|---|
|Shares|1/6|Residue|
|Base number|6|6|
|Portions|1|5|
|Number of heads|1|6|

|New base number|36|Col3|

|Portions|4|1|1|
|Number of heads|5|1|1|
|New base number|30|30|30|
|New portions|4 apiece|5|5|



Full sister is acting as a residuary with another. She is given 1 portion.
Likewise, mother receives 1 portion. But 5 daughters cannot share 4 portions.
So,
Number of heads of 5 daughters = 5
Base number = 6
New base number = 5 × 6 = 30
New portion of 5 daughters: 30 × 2/3 = 20; which is shared among them
equally. Each daughter gets 20 portions ÷ 5 = 4 portions
New portion of Mother: 30 × 1/6 = 5
New portion of full sister: Residue i.e. 30 – (20 + 5) = 5

**Rule J:** Given a category of heirs that cannot share its portion of the estate, if
the number of heads of heirs in the category and their number of portions
have a common divisor, divide the NUMBER OF HEADS by the common
divisor, then use the answer to multiply the base number. The result is the

|base number. mple 18|Col2|Col3|Col4|

|Heirs|Father|Mother|6 daughters|

Father’s share is “1/6 + residue” but there is no residue, as a result, he gets
1/6 only.
6 daughters cannot share 4 portions
Number of heads of daughters = 6
Number of portions of daughters = 4
What is the relationship between 6 and 4? They converge because THEY
HAVE a common divisor, 2. Therefore, DIVIDE the number of heads by the
common divisor and MULTIPLY the answer with the base number. The
result is the new base number. Thus,


57


New base number = 6 ÷ 2 = 3 × 6 = 18
New portion of Father: 18 × 1/6 = 3
New portion of Mother: 18 × 1/6 = 3
New portion of 6 daughters: 18 × 2/3 = 12
Each daughter inherits 12 portions ÷ 6 = 2 portions
The complete table then is,

5 sons and 5 daughters cannot share 5 portions
Number of heads of 5 sons and 5 daughters = 15
Common divisor of 15 and 5 = 5
New base number = 15 ÷ 5 = 3 × 12 = 36
New portion of Husband: 36 × ¼ = 9
New portion of Mother: 36 × 1/6 = 6
New portion of Father: 36 × 1/6 = 6
New portion of 5 sons and 5 daughters: 36 – (9 + 6 + 6) = 15
Each son gets 2 portions while each daughter receives 1.

**Level 2(b): Two categories of heirs cannot share their portions of the**
**estate AND there is no common divisor between the number of heads**
**and the corresponding number of portions of BOTH categories i.e. they**
**are parallel**

**Rule K:** If the number of heads in both categories are the same, pick one and
multiply it by the base number to get a new base number


58


|xample 20|Col2|Col3|Col4|

|New base number|24|24|24|
|New portions|Each = 3|Each = 8|Each = 1|


The two full sisters can share the 8 portions allotted to them such that each
gets 4 portions. But 2 wives cannot share 3 portions of the estate. Likewise, 2
consanguine brothers cannot share 1 portion. Meaning that, we have 2
categories of heirs that cannot share their portions. That is the first criteria of
applying the rules of Level 2(b). The second is that the number of heads and
the corresponding number of portions of BOTH categories MUST be
parallel. The example above also fulfils the second criteria in that the
category “wives” has 2 heads and 3 portions. 2 and 3 are parallel since they
have no common divisor. Similarly, 2 and 1, the number of heads and
number of portions of category “consanguine brothers” respectively are
parallel! But WHY is the number of heads of consanguine brothers said to be
2? If every male has “2 heads,” then the total number of heads of 2
consanguine brothers should be 4! Yes, very true. But recall the point noted
in Example 2; that **if all heirs are male, each should be considered as**
**having “1 head” so as to reduce the base number. The principle also**
**applies when ALL heirs in a category are male.** Thus, the number of heads
of 2 consanguine brothers HERE is 2 since only the two of them make a
category. There is no female among them.
Now, applying Rule K, the number of heads of both categories that
cannot share their portions are the same. So,
New base number = 2 × 12 = 24
New portion of wives: 24 × ¼ = 6
New portion of 2 full sisters: 24 × 2/3 = 16
New portion of 2 consanguine brothers: 24 – (6 + 16) = 2
Each wife, full sister and consanguine brother inherits 3, 8 and 1 portions
respectively.

**Rule L:** If the number of heads in one category is a multiple of the number
of heads in the other category, use the higher number to multiply the base
number so as to generate a new base number

|New base number|32|32|32|
|New portions|Each wife = 2|16|Each uncle = 3|


The categories that cannot share their portions are “wives” and “half uncles”
because in the former, 2 wives cannot share 1 portion, while in the latter, 4
half uncles cannot share 3 portions. Also, 2 and 1 are parallel, just as 4 and 3
are parallel. Now, looking at the number of heads in both categories, 4 is a
multiple of 2, so we pick the higher one, 4. Therefore,
New base number = 4 × 8 = 32
New portion of 2 wives: 32 × 1/8 = 4
New portion of daughter: 32 × ½ = 16
New portion of 4 half uncles: 32 – (4 + 16) = 12
Note that the number of heads of 4 half uncles suppose to be 8, but
given that there is no female among them, each one is considered as having
“1 head.” Assuming 8 was used instead of 4; the problem should have been

|ike this.|Col2|Col3|Col4|

|Number of heads|2|1|8|
|New base number|64|64|64|
|New portions|Each wife = 4|32|Each uncle = 6|



Number of heads of “half uncles” category, 8, is a multiple of 2, the number
of heads of “wives” category. As a result, 8 is chosen. Thus,
New base number = 8 × 8 = 64; which is more than the 32 earlier gotten.
In line with this, let’s revisit Example 20 and use 4 as the number of
heads of the 2 consanguine brothers instead of 2. By doing that, Rule L will
be applied rather than Rule K. So,

|Heirs|2 wives|2 full sisters|2 consanguine brothers|
|---|---|---|---|
|Shares|¼|2/3|Residue|
|Base number|12|12|12|
|Portions|3|8|1|
|Number of heads|2|2|4|
|New base number|48|48|48|
|New portions|Each = 6|Each = 16|Each = 2|



60


As in Example 21, the number of heads of “consanguine brothers” category,
4, is a multiple of 2, the number of heads of “wives” category, hence 4 is
picked, being the higher number.
New base number = 4 × 12 = 48; which is also more than the 24 earlier
gotten.
Therefore, it is evident that in both cases, the new base number is
doubled when each male in an exclusive male category is considered to have
“2 heads.” And as the principle of base number is that the MINIMUM is
always chosen, the previous solutions are hereby retained. This further
buttresses the fact that males are believed to have “1 head” when they are the
only heirs OR when they are the only ones in a category!

**Rule M:** When the number of heads in both categories is parallel, multiply
them; then multiply the answer by the base number. The result obtained is
the new base number

2 wives cannot share 3 portions and 3 uterine sisters cannot share 4 portions
of the estate. In both categories, number of heads and number of portions are
parallel. That is, 2 and 3 for wives and 3 and 4 for uterine sisters
respectively. Also, the number of heads in both categories, 2 (wives) and 3
(uterine sisters) are equally parallel. Hence,
New base number = 2 × 3 = 6 × 12 = 72
New portion of 2 Wives: 72 × ¼ = 18
New portion of 3 uterine sisters: 72 × 1/3 = 24
New portion of Full brother’s son: 72 – (18 + 24) = 30
Each wife and uterine sister is given 9 and 8 portions respectively, while full
brother’s son receives 30 portions.

**Rule N:** If the numbers of heads of the two categories that cannot share their
portions have a common divisor, divide ANY of them by the common
divisor, then multiply the result by the OTHER. Finally, multiply the solution
obtained by the base number. The end result gives the new base number


61


Example 23

|---|---|---|
|Shares|2/3|1/3|
|Base number|3|3|
|Portions|2|1|
|New base number|54|54|
|New portions|4 apiece|3 apiece|



Both categories cannot share their portions. In addition, the number of heads
and number of portions for both categories (i.e. 9 and 2; 6 and 1) are parallel.
But considering the number of heads 9 and 6, they have a common divisor, 3.
Consequently,
New base number = 9 ÷ 3 = 3 × 6 = 18 × 3 = 54; alternatively,
New base number = 6 ÷ 3 = 2 × 9 = 18 × 3 = 54
New portion of 9 daughters: 54 × 2/3 = 36
New portion of 6 uterine brothers: 54 – 36 = 18
Each daughter and uterine brother gets 4 and 3 portions respectively.

**Level 2(c): Two categories of heirs cannot share their portions of the**
**estate. However, the number of heads and number of portions of one**
**category HAVE a common divisor, while the number of heads and the**
**number of portions of the other category ARE PARALLEL.**
Recall that whenever two or more numbers converge, it means that
they have a common divisor. Now, if any on the numbers is divided by the
common divisor, the result is called _WAFQ_ of that number which I translate
as ADJUST. For instance, 6, 15 and 21 converge because their common
divisor is 3.
6 ÷ 3 = 2 15 ÷ 3 = 5 21 ÷ 3 = 7
Thus, the _wafq_ or adjust of 6 is 2, adjust of 15 is 5 and adjust of 21 is
7. Notice that it is the technical name used to identify the result of the
division that is being introduced here; otherwise nothing is new.

**Rule O:** If the ADJUST of the category that has a common divisor is the
same with the NUMBER OF HEADS of the category that has no common
divisor, select any of them and multiply by the base number. The result is the

Mother gets her 1 portion. She has no problem. 6 daughters cannot share 4
portions. Likewise, 3 grandsons cannot share 1 portion. But in the
“daughters” category, the number of heads, 6, and the number of portions, 4,
have a common divisor, 2. Consequently,
6 ÷ 2 = 3 4 ÷ 2 = 2
So, adjusts of the “daughters” category are 3 and 2. But a general rule is that
**only the adjust resulting from division of number of heads is considered.**
Therefore, 3 will be used in this case.
As for the “grandson” category, the number of heads, 3, and the
number of portions, 1, have no common divisor. Applying the rule, the adjust
of the “daughters” category which has a common divisor, 3, is the same with
the number of heads of the “grandson” category that has no common divisor.
So, one of them is selected. Thus,
New base number = 3 × 6 = 18
New portion of Mother: 18 × 1/6 = 3
New portion of 6 Daughters: 18 × 2/3 = 12
New portion of 3 Grandsons: 18 – (3 + 12) = 3
Each daughter and grandson inherits 2 and 1 portions respectively.

**Rule P:** Examine the ADJUST of the category whose number of heads and
number of portions have a common divisor along with the NUMBER OF
HEADS of the category with no common divisor. If one is a multiple of the
other, multiply the higher one with the base number to arrive at the new base

|Portions|1|3|
|Number of heads|4|6|
|New base number|16|16|
|New portions|Each wife = 1|Each brother = 4; each sister = 2|



“Wives” category: 4 wives cannot share 1 portion; and there is no common
divisor between 4 (number of heads) and 1 (number of portions).
“Full brothers and sisters” category: 2 full brothers and 2 full sisters cannot
share 3 portions; but there is a common divisor between 6 (number of heads)
and 3 (number of portions). It’s 3. Note that since the category has both male
and female heirs, each male is taken to have “2 heads.” Therefore,
Adjust = 6 ÷ 3 = 2


63


But the number of heads of “wives” category, 4, is a multiple of 2, the adjust
of the “full brothers and full sisters” category. So,
New base number = 4 × 4 = 16
New portion of 4 Wives: 16 ÷ ¼ = 4
New portion of 2 Full brothers and 2 full sisters: 16 – 4 = 12
Each wife, full brother and full sister is given 1, 4 and 2 portions
respectively.

**Rule Q:** In a situation whereby there is a parallel relationship between the
ADJUST of the category whose number of heads and number of portions
have a common divisor and the NUMBER OF HEADS of the category that
has no common divisor, multiply the adjust with the number of heads, then
further multiply the answer with the base number to get the new base

|New portions|Each daughter = 3|Grandson = 4; granddaughter = 2|



“Daughters” category: 4 daughters cannot share 2 portions; but their number
of heads, 4, and number of portions, 2, have a common divisor, 2. Thus,
Adjust = 4 ÷ 2 = 2
“Grandchildren” category: 1 grandson and 1 granddaughter cannot share 1
portion; and there is no common divisor of 3 (number of heads) and 1
(number of portions).
But, the adjust and number of heads, 2 and 3 respectively are parallel.
New base number = 2 × 3 = 6 × 3 = 18
New portion of 4 daughters: 18 × 2/3 = 12
New portion of grandson and granddaughter: 18 – 12 = 6
Each daughter is given 3 portions. Grandson and granddaughter each receive
4 and 2 portions respectively.

**Rule R:** Whenever the ADJUST of the category whose number of heads and
number of portions have a common divisor and the NUMBER OF HEADS
of the category that has no common divisor converge, divide any of them by
the common divisor and multiply by the other. Again, multiply the answer by
the base number to generate a new base number

“Daughters” category: 8 daughters cannot share 2 portions; but there is a
common divisor of 8 (number of heads) and 2 (number of portions). It’s 2.
Thus,
Adjust = 8 ÷ 2 = 4
“Consanguine brothers” category: 6 brothers cannot share 1 portion; and
there is no common divisor of 6 (number of heads) and 1 (number of
portions).
Now, the adjust and the number of heads of brothers, 4 and 6 respectively
incidentally converge. Therefore, what is the common divisor of 4 and 6? 2.
New base number = 4 ÷ 2 = 2 × 6 = 12 × 3 = 36
Alternatively, 6 ÷ 2 = 3 × 4 = 12 × 3 = 36
New portion of 8 daughters: 36 × 2/3 = 24
New portion of 6 consanguine brothers: 36 – 24 = 12
Each daughter and brother receives 3 and 2 portions respectively.

**Level 2(d): Two categories of heirs cannot share their portions of the**
**estate but the number of heads and corresponding number of portions of**
**BOTH categories CONVERGE i.e. have a common divisor**

**Rule S:** Consider the ADJUSTS of both categories. If they are the same,
choose one and multiply it by the base number to obtain the new base
number

|New portions|2|Each brother = 1|Each brother = 1|



4 uterine brothers cannot share 2 portions; but 4 (number of heads) and 2
(number of portions) converge. Their common divisor is 2.


65


6 consanguine brothers cannot share 3 portions; also their number of heads,
6, and number of portions, 3, converge. Common divisor of 6 and 3 is 3.
Adjust of uterine brothers = 4 ÷ 2 = 2
Adjust of consanguine brothers = 6 ÷ 3 = 2
The two adjusts are the same. The rule says, select any and multiply by the
base number, so
New base number = 2 × 6 = 12
New portion of mother: 12 × 1/6 = 2
New portion of 4 uterine brothers: 12 × 1/3 = 4
New portion of 6 consanguine brothers: 12 – (2 + 4) = 6

**Rule T:** If one ADJUST is a multiple of the other, multiply the higher one by
the base number. The result is the new base number

|Example 29|Col2|Col3|Col4|

|New base number|24|24|24|
|New portions|4|Each sibling = 1|Each brother = 2|



Grandmother is given her 1 portion. She has no problem.
4 uterine brothers and 4 uterine sisters cannot share 2 portions. However, 8
(their number of heads) and 2 (their number of portions) converge. The
common divisor of 8 and 2 is 2.
But wait a minute, the category “uterine brothers and uterine sisters”
is made up of males and females. And as stated earlier, in this circumstance,
males have “2 heads,” therefore, number of heads of 4 uterine brothers and 4
uterine sisters should be 12 not 8! Yes, that’s true. We forgot to mention that
that principle applies only when the males in the category will receive twice
the portion of the females. Recall Example 26 above. The category
“grandson and granddaughter” is said to have 3 heads. Why? Because
grandson is entitled to two times the number of portions of granddaughter.
Thus, he has “2 heads” while granddaughter has “1 head” making 3 heads.
That is why their new portions were 4 and 2 respectively. As for uterine
siblings, they share their portion of the estate in equal proportions
irrespective of gender, so all of them are regarded as having “1 head.”
Consequently, number of heads of 4 uterine brothers and 4 uterine sisters is
8.


66


Adjust of 4 uterine brothers and 4 uterine sisters = 8 ÷ 2 = 4
Similarly, 6 full brothers cannot share 3 portions; nevertheless 6 and 3
converge. Common divisor of 6 and 3 is 3.
Adjust of 6 full brothers = 6 ÷ 3 = 2
Now, the two adjusts, 4 and 2, one is a multiple of the other. Applying the
rule,
New base number = 4 × 6 = 24
New portion of grandmother: 24 × 1/6 = 4
New portion of 4 uterine brothers and 4 uterine sisters: 24 × 1/3 = 8
New portion of 6 full brothers: 24 – (4 + 8) = 12
Each uterine sibling gets 1 portion of the estate while each full bother inherits
2 portions.

**Rule U:** If the ADJUSTS of the two categories that cannot share their
portions are PARALLEL, i.e. have no common divisor, multiply both
adjusts, then multiply the answer by the base number. This gives the new

|---|---|---|---|
|Heirs|6 Full sisters|4 uterine brothers|Mother|
|Shares|2/3|1/3|1/6|
|Base number|6|6|6|
|Portions|4|2|1|



Is there anything intriguing in this example? Probably not obvious. OK, take
some time to add up the number of portions. 4 + 2 + 1 = 7. This is greater
than the base number. So, what comes to mind? _‘Awl_ (increment of base
number)! But as stated earlier, even if base number is increased, the number
of portions of each category of heir is not affected. Hence, 6 full sisters
cannot share 4 portions; similarly, 4 uterine brothers cannot share 2 portions.
Mother has no problem.
Adjust of full sisters = 6 ÷ 2 = 3 (Common divisor of 6 and 4 is 2).
Adjust of uterine brothers = 4 ÷ 2 = 2 (Common divisor of 4 and 2 is 2).
The adjusts, 3 and 2 are parallel.
New base number = 3 × 2 = 6 × 7 = 42 (Observe that the base number was
increased from 6 to 7).
IMPORTANT: Whenever the base number is increased, original shares are
not used to determine new portions. New shares are “created” for each
category such that the NUMBER OF PORTIONS serves as the numerator
while the denominator is the INCREASED BASE NUMBER. Therefore,
New share of 6 full sisters = 4/7
New share of 4 uterine brothers = 2/7
New share of mother = 1/7. Consequently,


67


New portion of 6 full sisters: 42 × 4/7 = 24
New portion of 4 uterine brothers: 42 × 2/7 = 12
New portion of mother: 42 × 1/7 = 6
Total number of portions: 24 + 12 + 6 = 42!
If the original shares (2/3, 1/3 and 1/6) were used, the total number of
portions would have been 49. Confirm that please. As a result, the final table

|ld look like this.|Col2|Col3|Col4|

|New shares|4/7|2/7|1/7|
|New base number|42|42|42|
|New portions|Each sister = 4|Each brother = 3|6|



**Rule V:** When the ADJUSTS of both categories of heirs that cannot share
their portions of the estate in turn CONVERGE, i.e. have a common divisor,
divide any of the adjusts by their common divisor, multiply the solution by
the other adjust. Finally multiply the answer by the by the base number. The
result is the new base number

|New portions|Each son = 2|12|Each uterine = 3|



Adjust of 18 full uncles’ sons = 18 ÷ 3 = 6
Adjust of 2 uterine brothers and 6 uterine sisters = 8 ÷ 2 = 4
(The background explanations have been skipped. It is assumed that by now,
the reader is conversant with the procedure).
But the adjusts, 6 and 4 converge. Their common divisor is 2. Accordingly,
New base number = 6 ÷ 2 = 3 × 4 = 12 × 6 = 72
Alternatively, 4 ÷ 2 = 2 × 6 = 12 × 6 = 72
New portion of Mother: 72 × 1/6 = 12
New portion of 2 uterine brothers and 6 uterine sisters: 72 × 1/3 = 24
New portion of 18 uncles’ sons: 72 – (12 + 24) = 36
Note that the portions of mother and the uterines have to be determined first
before knowing what the residue will be.


68


**LEVEL 3**
**Three or more categories of heirs cannot share their portions of the**
**estate.**
Generally, the maximum number of categories that cannot share their
portions is three. But we have decided to say “three or more” because the
rule of solving for three categories is applicable to four, five and so on (if
such higher order problems exist). Remember how to determine the LCM of
3 or more numbers? Select any two, find their LCM. Call it ‘X’. Then find
the LCM of ‘X’ and the third number. Name this ‘Y’, and proceed like that
until all the numbers are exhausted. That is how to solve Level 3 problems.
There is no clear-cut rule on which categories to start with. One has the
liberty to select any two. But for simplification, the following may be very
handy.

**Rule W:** Examine the categories that cannot share their portions. Select any
two that are SIMILAR and resolve them using the appropriate rule. Let the
solution be ‘X’. Next, consider ‘X’ along with the next category; resolve
them using the appropriate rule. Continue like that until all the categories
have been resolved. Thereafter, multiply the end result by the base number to
obtain the new base number.
From the above, it will be deduced that Level 3 has no any new rule.
Depending on the problem at hand, the appropriate rules from (K) to (V) are

Question 1: What categories are not able to share their portions?
Answer: “Daughters,” “wives” and “full sisters” categories.
Question 2: What is the relationship between the number of heads and
number of portions of these categories?
Answer: “Daughters” category: 10 and 16 converge.
“Wives” category: 2 and 3 are parallel.
“Full sisters” category: 6 and 1 are parallel.
Question 3: Since two categories are parallel, consider them first. What is the
relationship between their numbers of heads?
Answer: 2 (number of heads of wives) and 6 (number of heads of full
sisters); one is a multiple of the other.
Question 4: What do we do?
Answer: Select the higher one.


69


Question 5: Which is…
Answer: 6
Question 6: What rule is that?
Answer: Rule L, “If the number of heads in one category is a multiple of the
number of heads in the other category, use the higher number to multiply the
base number.” But we do NOT multiply by the base number, until all the
categories have been resolved.
Question 7: What is the adjust of “daughters” category that converges?
Answer: Common divisor of 10 and 16 is 2. Therefore, adjust of “daughters”
category is 10 ÷ 2 = 5.
Question 8: What is the relationship between 6 and 5; solutions of questions
5 and 7 respectively?
Answer: They are parallel.
Question 9: What do we do?
Answer: Apply Rule P, “In a situation whereby there is a parallel relationship
between the ADJUST of the category whose number of heads and number of
portions have a common divisor and the NUMBER OF HEADS of the
category that has no common divisor, multiply the adjust with the number of
head.” That is 5 × 6 = 30.
Question 10: Anymore category to resolve?
Answer: No.
Question 11: What next?
Answer: Apply Rule W, “…Thereafter, multiply the end result by the base
number to obtain the new base number.”
Question 12: So, what is the new base number?
Answer: 5 × 6 = 30 × 24 = 720
Question 13: Determine the new portion of each category of heir.
Answer: 10 daughters: 720 × 2/3 = 480 portions
2 wives: 720 × 1/8 = 90 portions
Mother: 720 × 1/6 = 120 portions
6 full sisters: 720 – (480 + 90 + 120) = 30 portions

Using the procedure above but with less explanation and
incorporating the original technical Arabic terms (for familiarisation), this
problem can be solved as follows:
“Wives” category: Number of heads, 2, and number of portions, 3, are
_tabayin_ (parallel).
Mother has no problem. Note that if a category consists of only ONE heir,
he/she simply takes whatever is allocated to the category even if it’s 1
portion. That is why all along, mother do not use to have problem for the fact
that one cannot have two mothers!
“Uterine sisters” category: Number of heads, 6, and number of portions, 4,
are _tawafuq_ (converge).
“Consanguine brothers” category: Number of heads, 2, and number of
portions, 3, are _tabayin_ (parallel).
Considering the two that are _tabayin_, number of heads of wives, 2 and the
number of heads of consanguine brothers, 2 are _tamathul_ (same). So, one is
chosen (Rule K).
As for the “uterine sisters” category, the _wafq_ (adjust) is 3. Now, 2 (selected
number of heads) and 3 ( _wafq_ ) are _tabayin,_ so we multiply them (Rule Q).
This gives 2 × 3 = 6. Finally,
New base number = 2 × 3 = 6 × 12 = 72.
New portion of 2 wives: 72 × ¼ = 18
New portion of mother: 72 × 1/6 = 12
New portion of 6 uterine sisters: 72 × 1/3 = 24
New portion of 2 consanguine brothers: 72 – (18 + 12 + 24) = 18
The table will now look like this.

2 grandmothers can share their 4 portions.
“Grandchildren” category: 10 and 1 are _tabayin._
“Daughters” category: 12 and 16 are _tawafuq_ .
“Wives” category: 4 and 3 are _tabayin_ .
Number of heads of “grandchildren” and “wives” categories, 10 and 4
respectively are _tawafuq_ . Apply Rule N.
W _afq_ of 10 and 4 = 10 ÷ 2 = 5 × 4 = 20; or 4 ÷ 2 = 2 × 10 = 20.
The _wafq_ of “daughters” category is 3. How?
Actually, common divisors of 12 and 16 are 2 and 4.
Using 2, _wafq_ of 12 daughters = 12 ÷ 2 = 6
With 4, _wafq_ of 12 daughters = 12 ÷ 4 = 3
Recall that only the Highest Common Divisor (HCD) is considered. That is
why the _wafq_ of division by 4 is chosen.
Now, what is the relationship between the two adjusts ( _wafqan_ ) 20 and 3?
They are _tabayin_ . So, we multiply them (Rule U).
Finally, new base number = 20 × 3 = 60 × 24 = 1440
New portion of 2 grandmothers: 1440 × 1/6 = 240
New portion of 12 daughters: 1440 × 2/3 = 960
New portion of 4 wives: 1440 × 1/8 = 180
New portion of 2 granddaughters and 4 grandsons: 1440 – (240 + 960 + 180)
= 60
Had it being 2 was chosen to be the common divisor of 12 and 16,
the _wafq_ of 12 daughters should have been 6 (as above). But then the new
base number would be = 20 × 6 = 120 × 24 = 2880 which is double of 1440.
Not that 2880 is wrong, however the principle of base number is that the
minimum value is used.
Rule W says, “Select any two SIMILAR categories and resolve them
using the appropriate rule.” What happens if intentionally or otherwise,
DISSIMILAR categories are selected first and resolved, will the new base
number still be the same? Yes! Let’s prove it.
“Grandchildren” category: 10 and 1 are _tabayin_ .
“Daughters” category: 12 and 16 are _tawafuq_ .


72


“Wives” category: 4 and 3 are _tabayin_ .
Instead of considering the two categories that are _tabayin_ as before, let’s
resolve the “grandchildren” and “daughters” categories first. Since the
number of heads and number of portions of grandchildren is _tabayin_, the
emphasis shifts to the number of heads, 10. The _wafq_ of 12 daughters is 3 (as
explained earlier). Now, what is the relationship between 10 and 3? _Tabayin_ .
So, we multiply them (Rule Q).
10 × 3 = 30
The number of heads and number of portions of 4 wives is also _tabayin_ .
Again, the number of heads, 4, is considered. What is the relationship
between 30 and 4? _Tawafuq_ . Common divisor of 30 and 4 is 2. Therefore,
New base number = 30 ÷ 2 = 15 × 4 = 60 × 24 = 1440
Alternatively, 4 ÷ 2 = 2 × 30 = 60 × 24 = 1440
As a result, selecting and resolving similar or dissimilar categories of heirs
that cannot share their portions do not make any difference. But choosing and
resolving similar categories first simplify the problem.

**Exercise 2**
A deceased leaves behind two wives, five daughters and three full brothers.
How will the estate be shared among them?

**CHAPTER SEVEN**
**INHERITANCE OF GRANDFATHER ALONG WITH SIBLINGS**
_It is advised that the reader takes sometime to skim through_
_Inheritance of Grandfather to better appreciate this chapter._
To start with, siblings are full brothers, full sisters, consanguine
brothers and consanguine sisters. Uterine brothers and sisters are equally
siblings but they do not inherit along with grandfather because he excludes
them. Inheritance of grandfather can be divided into four (4) parts.
i) Grandfather inherits along with full brother(s), full sister(s) or a
combination of full brother(s) and full sister(s) in the ABSENCE of
other heirs. Any conclusion made regarding the “fulls” also applies
to their consanguine counterparts.
ii) Grandfather inherits along with combination of “fulls” and
“consanguines” in the ABSENCE of other heirs.
iii) Grandfather inherits along with full brother(s), full sister(s) or a
combination of full brother(s) and full sister(s) in the PRESENCE of
other heirs. Any conclusion made also applies to their consanguine
counterparts.
iv) Grandfather inherits along with combination of “fulls” and
“consanguines” in the PRESENCE of other heirs.

**Inheritance of grandfather along with full brother(s), full sister(s) or a**
**combination of full brother(s) and full sister(s) in the ABSENCE of other**
**heirs**
He has two choices: 1/3 of the estate or _muqasama_ (sharing).
Example 35: Grandfather and full brother

|1/3 of the estate|Col2|Col3|
|---|---|---|
|Heirs|Grandfather|Full brother|
|Shares|1/3|Residue|
|Base number|3|3|
|Portions|1|2|


|Muqasama|Col2|Col3|
|---|---|---|
|Heirs|Grandfather|Full brother|
|Share|Whole estate|Whole estate|
|Base number|Number of heads = 2|Number of heads = 2|
|Portions|1|1|



Which of these options is more favourable to the grandfather? That is, which
option entitles him to a larger portion of the estate? The number of portions
he receives in both is 1. So how do we know which one is more favourable to
him? To answer this, we have to determine the VALUE of each by making


74


the number of portions and base number the numerator and denominator
respectively in both cases. Hence,
Value of portion if he inherits 1/3 of estate = 1/3
Value of estate if he agrees to _muqasama_ = ½
Therefore, _muqasama_ is more beneficial to him.
Sometimes, dealing with fractions is tasking especially when one is
to decide which one is larger and which one is smaller. For simplicity, it’s
recommended that fractions should be converted to decimal numbers. This
can be done with the aid of a calculator. Using the example above, 1/3 = 0.33
and ½ = 0.5.
Deciding which decimal number is greater is quite easy. Remember
how to arrange words in alphabetical order? If the first letters are the same,
consider the second letters; if they are the same, look at the third letters; and
so on. Same thing with numbers. Assuming we are asked to arrange 0.453,
0.345, 0.543 and 0.4512 in ascending order, the solution will be 0.345,
0.4513, 0.453 and 0.543.
Example 36: Grandfather and full sister
a) 1/3 of the estate

|Heirs|Grandfather|Full sister|
|---|---|---|
|Shares|1/3|½|
|Base number|6|6|
|Portions|2|3|
|Values|2/6 = 0.33|3/6 = 0.5|



There is 1 extra portion.

|Muqasama|Col2|Col3|
|---|---|---|
|Heirs|Grandfather|Full sister|
|Shares|Whole estate|Whole estate|
|Base number|3|3|
|Portions|2|1|
|Values|2/3 = 0.67|1/3 = 0.33|



Again, grandfather is advised to inherit by _muqasama_ .
Note that grandfather is ACTING as a full brother that is why the
base number (number of heads) is 3; he has “2 heads” and full sister has 1.
So in essence, we have just one category of heirs. Had it being grandfather
makes a category by himself, his number of heads should have been 1 as
established in the previous chapter; that a male is considered to have “1
head” if a category consists of exclusive males.

Example 37: Grandfather, full brother and full sister

|---|---|---|
|Heirs|Grandfather|Full brother; full sister|

|New portions|3|Brother = 4; sister = 2|
|Values|3/9 = 0.33|Brother = 0.44; sister = 0.22|



Full brother and sister cannot share their 2 portions. So, their number of
heads, 3 multiplied by base number, 3 gives 9 (new base number).

|b) Muqasama|Col2|Col3|

|Heirs|Grandfather|Full brother; full sister|

|Portions|2|Brother = 2; sister = 1|
|Values|2/5 = 0.4|Brother = 0.4; sister = 0.2|



_Muqasama_ is better for grandfather.

Example 38: Grandfather and 2 full brothers

|Muqasama|Col2|Col3|

|Heirs|Grandfather|2 Full brothers|

|Shares|1/3|Residue|
|Base number|3|3|
|Portions|1|Each brother = 1|
|Values|1/3 = 0.33|Each brother = 0.33|



Since grandfather gets 1/3 (0.33) of the estate in both cases, it makes no
difference whether he takes 1/3 out-rightly or chooses to share the estate with
the 2 brothers.

Example 39: Grandfather and 4 full sisters

Given that the value of grandfather’s portion is the same in both situations,
he is at liberty to choose any. Observe that Examples 38 and 39 are virtually
the same because the number of heads of those inheriting along with
grandfather i.e. 2 full brothers and 4 full sisters respectively is 4! Similarly,
the same scenario will play out if the surviving heirs are grandfather, 1
brother and 2 sisters of whatever combination. Confirm that please.
Consequently,

**Rule X:** Whenever brother(s), sister(s) or a combination of brother(s) and
sister(s) are inheriting along with grandfather, if their total number of heads
is exactly 4, the value of grandfather’s portion will be the same for both 1/3
of the estate and _muqasama_ . Hence, anyone he chooses makes no difference.
Example 40: Grandfather and 3 full brothers

|Muqasama|Col2|Col3|
|---|---|---|
|Heirs|Grandfather|3 Full brothers|

|New base number|9|9|
|New portions|3|Each brother = 2|
|Values|3/9 = 0.33|Each brother = 0.22|



0.33 is greater than 0.25; so grandfather should take 1/3 of the estate.


77


Example 41: Grandfather and 5 full sisters

Again, 1/3 of the estate is more beneficial to the grandfather.

Example 42: Grandfather, 2 full brother and 3 full sisters

1/3 of the estate is better for the grandfather.

**Rule Y:** _Muqasama_ is better for the grandfather whenever he inherits along
with AT MOST
a) 2 full brothers
b) 2 consanguine brothers
c) 4 full sisters
d) 4 consanguine sisters


78


e) 1 full brother and 2 full sisters
f) 1 consanguine brother and 2 consanguine sisters; otherwise he
should take 1/3 of the estate.

**Inheritance of grandfather along with combination of “fulls” and**
**“consanguines” in the ABSENCE of other heirs.**
This is my favourite section. I particularly like the tricky nature of
the rule.
**Rule Z:** When the surviving heirs of a deceased are grandfather and any
combination of full brother(s) or sister(s) and consanguine brother(s) or
sister(s), the “consanguines” ACT or BEHAVE as if they were “fulls.” When
grandfather takes his portion of the estate, “consanguines” REVERT to their
status and take THEIR ORIGINAL SHARES of the estate. The portion of
each (i.e. “fulls” and “consanguines”) is determined USING THE BASE
NUMBER.

Example 43: Grandfather, full brother and 3 consanguine sisters
Applying Rule Y, 1/3 of the estate will be more favourable to
grandfather than _muqasama_, so we do not need to solve for _muqasama._ The
first step is to modify the problem. It now becomes: grandfather, full brother
and 3 “full” sisters (Rule Z).

|Heirs|Grandfather|Full brother; 3 “full” sisters|
|---|---|---|
|Shares|1/3|Residue|
|Base number|3|3|
|Portions|1|2|
|New base number|15|15|
|New portions|5|Full brother = 4; each “full” sister = 2|
|Final portions|5|Full brother = 10;<br>consanguine sisters = 0|



Full brother and 3 “full” sisters cannot share 2 portions. Their number of
heads (5) and number of portions (2) are _tabayin_ (parallel). Therefore,
New base number = 5 × 3 = 15
New portion of grandfather = 15 × 1/3 = 5
New portion of full brother and 3 full sisters = 15 – 5 = 10
Full brother gets 4 while each “full” sister inherits 2 portions.
Consanguine sisters then revert to their status. But then, full brother is
originally a residuary by himself. **He excludes consanguine sisters and**
**inherits the whole residue.** The implication is that consanguine sisters will
surrender their portions to the full brother. Thus, their FINAL PORTIONS
are: full brother = 10; consanguine sisters = 0


79


Example 44: Grandfather, 2 full sisters and consanguine brother
Number of heads of siblings is 4, so whichever option grandfather
chooses makes no difference. Bear in mind that the problem becomes:
grandfather, 2 full sisters and “full” brother; but it will not be indicated in the

|as such. 1/3 of the estate|Col2|Col3|

|Heirs|Grandfather|2 full sisters; consanguine brother|

|New base number|6|6|
|New portions|2|Each full sister = 1;<br> consanguine brother = 2|
|Final portions|2|Each full sister = 2;<br>consanguine brother = 0|



Number of heads of 2 full sisters and consanguine brother, 4, converges with
their number of portions, 2. So, new base number = 2 (adjust) × 3 = 6. When
consanguine brother reverts to his status, he becomes a residuary while full
sisters are entitled to 2/3 of the estate. Hence, their final portion is 2/3 × 6 = 4
and each is given 2 portions. Since the estate is exhausted, consanguine

|gets nothing. Muqasama|Col2|Col3|

Example 45: Grandfather, 3 full sisters and 2 consanguine sisters
1/3 of the estate is more favourable for grandfather because number of heads
of sisters is greater than 4.

|Heirs|Grandfather|3 Full sisters; 2 consanguine sisters|
|---|---|---|
|Shares|1/3|Residue|

80


|Newest base number|9|Col3|
|---|---|---|
|Newest portions|3|Each full sister = 2|


New base number = 5 × 3 = 15
New portion of grandfather = 15 × 1/3 = 5
New portion of 3 full sisters and 2 consanguine sisters = 15 – 5 = 10
Original portion of 3 full sisters = 2/3 × 15 = 10
This means that 2 consanguine sisters will have nothing. But 3 full sisters
cannot share their 10 portions, so another base number is determined once
more. Number of heads of 3 full sisters (3) and their number of portions (10)
is _tabayin_ . Therefore, number of heads is multiplied by the base number.
Another problem: there are two base numbers 3 and 15! What to do is to
choose the one that will give a lower “newest” base number.
Newest base number = 3 × 3 = 9
Newest portion of grandfather = 9 × 1/3 = 3
Newest portion of 3 full sisters = 9 × 2/3 = 6; each sister is given 2 portions.

**Inheritance of grandfather along with full brother(s), full sister(s) or a**
**combination of full brother(s) and full sister(s) in the PRESENCE of**
**other heirs.**
In the presence of other heir(s), grandfather has three (3) choices.
He is to choose whichever is most favourable to him. They are: 1/6 of the
estate, 1/3 of the residue or _muqasama_ (sharing). Note that Rules X and Y
are not applicable here.

Example 46: Wife, grandfather and 3 full brothers

3 full brothers cannot share 7 portions. 3 and 7 are _tabayin_, so new base

|---|---|---|---|

|Newest portions|3|3|Each brother = 2|
|Values|0.25|0.25|Each brother = 0.17|


Number of heads of grandfather and 3 full brothers = 4, and they cannot
share 3 portions. So, new base number = 4 × 4 = 16.
New portion of wife: 16 × ¼ = 4
Residue = 16 – 4 = 12
New portion of grandfather: 1/3 × 12 = 4
Actual residue for 3 full brothers = 16 – (4 + 4) = 8. But 3 brothers cannot
share 8 portions. Once again, another base number is determined.
Newest base number = 3 (number of heads of 3 brothers) × 4 (least base
number) = 12
Newest portion of wife: 12 × ¼ = 3
Residue = 12 – 3 = 9
Newest portion of grandfather: 9 × 1/3 = 3
Newest portion of 3 full brothers (residue): 12 – (3 + 3) = 6; each brother

|Values|0.25|Each = 0.19|Each = 0.19|



New portion of grandfather and 3 full brothers = 48 – 12 = 36; each person
gets 36 ÷ 4 = 9 portions.
Remember that the value of portions is the variable considered to
determine the best choice not the number of portions. Thus, 1/3 of the residue
is most favourable to grandfather since he will be entitled to 0.25 of the
estate as against 0.17 or 0.19 if he has chosen 1/6 of the estate or _muqasama_
respectively.

Example 47: Husband, daughter, grandfather and full sister

Grandfather may choose either 1/6 of the estate or inherit by _muqasama_ .
Notice that he is inheriting along with only one full sister, yet his value of
portion is the same for both options. That is why in the presence of other
heirs, Rules X and Y are not applicable.

**Inheritance of grandfather along with combination of “fulls” and**
**“consanguines” in the PRESENCE of other heirs**

_Muqasama_ is better for grandfather. And the interesting thing is that no heir
has the right to oppose any choice he makes. In this example for instance, the
two consanguine brothers are not allowed to persuade the grandfather to take
1/6 of the estate, since by _muqasama_ or 1/3 of residue they will have nothing.
It is necessary to determine the number of portions and value of
the estate grandfather is entitled to in all three cases before reaching a
conclusion; otherwise, he will be wrongly excluded when he should actually
be entitled to a share. The following exercise will prove that.

**Exercise 3**
A woman leaves behind her husband, two daughters, mother, grandfather and
full brother. How will the estate be shared among them?


84


**CHAPTER EIGHT**
**SPECIAL CASES**
_**‘Umariyyataini**_ **(the two ‘Umar cases)**
Supposing a deceased is survived by his parents (mother and

|w will his estate|be distributed|among them?|
|---|---|---|
|Heirs|Mother|Father|
|Shares|1/3|Residue|
|Base number|3|3|
|Portions|1|2|



This shows that father inherits twice the share of mother in the absence of
children or any descendant through son. Now consider the following:

**Case 1:** A man dies leaving behind a wife, mother and father

|Heirs|Wife|Mother|Father|
|---|---|---|---|
|Shares|¼|1/3|Residue|
|Base number|12|12|12|
|Portions|3|4|5|



**Case 2:** A woman is survived by her husband, mother and father

|Heirs|Husband|Mother|Father|
|---|---|---|---|
|Shares|½|1/3|Residue|
|Base number|6|6|6|
|Portions|3|2|1|



Observe that in Case 1, the number of portions of mother is almost the same
with that of the father; while in Case 2, her number of portions doubles his.
Though the distributions are correct, they violate the principle that father gets
twice the share or number of portions of mother in the absence of children or
descendants through son. These pair of problems arose during the Caliphate
of ‘Umar. That is why they are symbolically referred to as _‘Umariyyataini_ .
The resolution was that instead of giving mother 1/3 of the estate,
she should be given 1/3 OF THE RESIDUE so as to maintain the ratio of 2 to
1 between father and mother. Therefore, Case 1 becomes

|Heirs|Wife|Mother|Father|
|---|---|---|---|
|Shares|¼|Residue|Residue|
|Base number|4|4|4|
|Portions|1|1|2|



Residue = 4 – 1 = 3
Mother inherits 3 × 1/3 = 1 portion
Father is given 4 – (1 + 1) = 2 portions
Similarly, Case 2 can be resolved as follows


85


|Heirs|Husband|Mother|Father|
|---|---|---|---|
|Shares|½|Residue|Residue|
|Base number|2|2|2|
|Portions|1|1|1|
|New base number|6|6|6|
|New portions|3|1|2|


Residue = 6 – 3 = 3
New portion of mother: 3 × 1/3 = 1
New portion of father: 6 – (3 + 1) = 2
Recall that in the absence of a son, the grandson takes his place
and inherits all his rights and privileges. Likewise, in the absence of father,
grandfather replaces him but does not inherit all his privileges according to
the more popular view of scholars. As stated earlier, this is because father
excludes full and consanguine siblings but grandfather cannot exclude them.
_‘Umariyyataini_ is another. Unlike father, grandfather does not have the
“power” to relegate mother from 1/3 of the estate to 1/3 of the residue.
Therefore, if grandfather were to take the place of father in Cases 1 and 2, he
will be given 5 and 1 portions respectively. Adjustments shall not be made.

_**Mushtarika**_ **(Partnership)**
Problem: A lady leaves behind her husband, mother, two uterine brothers and
a full brother. How will her estate be distributed?

This also arose during the time of ‘Umar. Despite that the distribution was
correct; full brother protested on the ground that he was more related to the
deceased than the uterine brothers since he has the same father and mother
with her whereas uterine brothers have the same mother with her only. As a
result, it is not fair for the uterines to be entitled to a portion of the estate
while he is being left out. ‘Umar reasoned with him and instructed that he
shares 1/3 along with uterine brothers in equal proportion. The final table

|n becomes|Col2|Col3|Col4|Col5|

86


Imams Malik and As-Shafi’i supported this verdict though Ahmad
ibn Hanbal and Abu Hanifa opposed it for the fact that full brother is a
residuary who by definition inherits the whole estate when alone or takes the
residue, and if nothing is left (as in this problem), he goes empty handed.
Whereas the two ‘Umar cases are “heir-specific” i.e. applicable
when the heirs are wife, mother and father ONLY or husband, mother and
father ONLY, partnership is also applicable when the following are present:
i) More than two uterine brothers, two or more uterine sisters or a
combination of uterine brother(s) and sisters(s) because they all
inherit 1/3 of the estate.
ii) More than one full brother or a combination of full brother(s) and
full sister(s) since they are equally entitled to residue.
_Mushtarika_ does not apply if the heirs comprises of:
i) One uterine brother or sister given that he/she gets 1/6 of the estate
and this will distort the problem.
ii) One or more full sisters ONLY. The reason is that they have fixed
shares.
iii) One or more consanguine brother(s) or sister(s). Though they are
also residuaries, but are related to the deceased through the father
only.

_**Al-Akdariyya**_ **(Troublesome)**
Problem: A woman is survived by her husband, mother, grandfather and full
sister. (Consanguine sister may replace a full sister and the rule of _Akdariyya_
will still be valid).
Solution: Since grandfather is involved, the three options have to be

Grandfather acts as a full brother, so he takes twice the portion of full sister.
Thus, he inherits 2 portions out of the 3 residues, while full sister is given 1.
Conclusion: Grandfather may inherit either 1/6 of the estate or by _muqasama_ .
A closer look at the two options will reveal that in _muqasama_,
grandfather (acting as a full brother) gets twice the portion of full sister. That
is alright. But if he decides to take 1/6 of the estate, full sister’s portion is not
only double but three times his portion. That is one way of looking at it. The
second is that if the shares of husband, mother and grandfather are added
together, the estate gets exhausted and full sister receives nothing. That is,
½ (0.5) + 1/3 (0.33) + 1/6 (0.17) = 1.
This is also not acceptable according to most Jurists because full sister
cannot be excluded by husband, mother or grandfather. For this reason, the
problem is referred to as “troublesome.”
The resolution is that grandfather should agree to 1/6 of the estate
but then, his portion and that of full sister will be added and redistributed
among them in a ratio of 2 to 1. Thus,
Number of portion of grandfather and full sister = 1 + 3 = 4
Grandfather and full sister cannot share 4 portions.
Their number of heads, 3, and number of portions, 4, are _tabayin_ . Therefore,
New base number = 3 × 9 (increased base number) = 27
New share of husband = 3/9
New share of mother = 2/9
New share of grandfather = 1/9
New share of full sister = 3/9
New portion of husband: 27 × 3/9 = 9
New portion of mother: 27 × 2/9 = 6
New portion of grandfather: 27 × 1/9 = 3
New portion of full sister: 27 × 3/9 = 9
Now, add new portions of grandfather and full sister: 3 + 9 = 12. Grandfather
gets twice the portion of full sister. 12 is divided by 3. He takes 2 parts while
she is given remaining 1 part. Mathematically,
Newest portion of grandfather: 12 × 2/3 = 8

Newest portion of full sister: 12 × 1/3 = 4

Observe that we deviated from the principle that number of heads should be
multiplied by the lowest base number in order to generate a new base
number. This is because there was an increase in the base number ( _‘awl_ ), so
number of heads is multiplied by the increment. Also, note that the value of
grandfather’s portion is greater than what he should have received through
_muqasama_ . This was how the problem was solved by Zaid ibn Thabit, the
most knowledgeable companion of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) in
the Science of Inheritance. May Allah be pleased with them all. _Ameen_ .

**FURTHER READING**
1. _Radd_ (Decrease of base number)
This is the opposite of _‘awl_ . _Radd_ is applicable when the heirs
cannot exhaust the estate, thus the base number is decreased so as to
proportionately increase the share of each heir. Though there are particular
heirs who are not entitled to or do not benefit from _radd_ .
2. Inheritance of cognates ( _Zawul-Arham_ )
When rightful heirs do not exhaust the estate and _radd_ is not
applied, cognates are invited to inherit from the rest. The most popular
opinion is that cognate children step into the shoes of their agnate parents.
For instance, daughter’s son who is a non-heir is given the share of a
daughter. Cognates are classified into 4 and they also exclude one another.
3. _Munasakha_ (2-in-1 inheritance)
Say a man passes on leaving behind his wife and children. Before
his estate is distributed, the wife also dies. Note that although the wife is
absent, she will still inherit from the husband because she was alive at the
time he died. So, the husband’s estate will be distributed among the wife and
children. Thereafter, wife’s estate will be shared among the children. But
instead of doing this one after the other, the two distributions can be at once.
It’s a bit complex especially if the second deceased have heirs who are not
entitled to inherit from the first deceased.
4. _Takharuj_ (Removal)
An agreement between one of the heirs and the rest, that if he is
given a specific item FROM or OUTSIDE the estate, he will relinquish his
whole share of the estate.
5. Inheritance of foetus
A foetus may either be a significant or non-significant heir.
Significant in the sense that if delivered alive, some heirs will be excluded. In
that case, it is preferred that the estate is not shared until it is born. However,
if the estate has to be distributed, some rules will apply.
6. Inheritance of a missing person
A missing person can either be the one to be inherited or the heir.
If he is to be inherited his estate shall not be allotted to his heirs until he
attains 70 years of age (or 90 according to some Jurists). But before then, if
some rules are satisfied, the estate can be shared. On the other hand, when an
important heir that can distort the sharing formulae such as a son is missing,
unless he is officially pronounced dead by a court of law (after Shari’ahaccepted due process has being followed), no one will inherit from the estate
of the deceased. However, if it has to apportioned, some rule will come to
play.


92


7. Inheritance of a controversial heir
A person who claims to be an heir of a deceased such that the
claim is accepted by some heirs and rejected by others is said to be a
controversial heir. The estate will be distributed in such a way that those that
reject the controversial heir will get their full shares, while the share of those
that accept him will be deducted and given to him.
8. Inheritance of a hermaphrodite
Hermaphrodites may either be partial or total. A Partial
hermaphrodite is considered to be a male or female depending on the organ
that is functional or more functional. However, if both are functional in the
same proportion, the individual is said to be a total hermaphrodite and is
given half of both male and female portions of inheritance. Hence, its
number of heads is 1½.

**SOLUTIONS TO EXERCISES**

|---|---|---|---|
|Heirs|2 daughters|Mother|Father|
|Shares|2/3|1/6|1/6 + residue|
|Base number|6|6|6|
|Portions|Each daughter = 2|1|1|



Note that brother and sister are excluded by father.
2 daughters: 6 × 2/3 = 4 portions. Each daughter inherits 2.
Mother: 6 × 1/6 = 1 portion
Father: 6 × 1/6 = 1 portion
Check for residue: 6 – 4 – 1 – 1 = 0  or  6 – (4 + 1 + 1) = 0
Since there is no residue, the father receives just 1 portion like the mother.

|e 2|Col2|Col3|Col4|

|Heirs|2 Wives|5 Daughters|3 Full brothers|
|Shares|1/8|2/3|Residue|
|Base number|8 × 3 = 24|8 × 3 = 24|8 × 3 = 24|
|Portions|3|16|5|
|New base number|2 × 5 × 3 × 24 = 720|2 × 5 × 3 × 24 = 720|2 × 5 × 3 × 24 = 720|
|New portions|Each = 45|Each = 96|Each = 50|



None of the three categories of heirs can share their portions. So let’s
consider the relationship between their number of heads and number of
portions.
“Wives” category: 2 and 3 are _tabayin_ (parallel)
“Daughters” category: 5 and 16 are _tabayin_ (parallel)
“Full brothers” category: 3 and 5 are _tabayin_ (parallel)
Since all of them are parallel, their number of heads is considered. Taking
wives and daughters first, 2 and 5 are _tabayin,_ so multiply them. 2 × 5 = 10.
Now what is the relationship between 10 and 3 (heads of full brothers)?
_Tabayin_ . Again, multiply them. 10 × 3 = 30.
Hence, new base number = 30 × 24 = 720
New portion of 2 wives: 720 × 1/8 = 90; each has 45
New portion of 5 daughters: 720 × 2/3 = 480; each is given 96
New portion of 3 full brothers: 720 – (90 + 480) = 150; each inherits 50.

There is no residue, so 1/3 of residue does not exist. Hence, grandfather and
full brother inherits nothing.
_c)_ _Muqasama_
Here, grandfather is expected to share the residue with full brother.
But from the table above, there will be no residue to share. Hence
grandfather and full brother gets nothing. Therefore, 1/6 of the estate is the
most favourable to grandfather. The two other options do not entitle him to
any share of the estate.
