# Comprehensive Core Shariah Principles (Sunni: Hanafi & Shafi'i)

#### 1. Prerequisites of Succession (Arkan & Shurut)

For an inheritance distribution to be triggered, three conditions must legally and factually exist:

* **Death of the Testator (*Al-Muwarith*):** Must be proven medically or declared legally.
* **Survival of the Heir (*Al-Warith*):** The heir must be alive, even if only for a moment, after the testator's death. (A fetus inherits if born alive).
* **Existence of an Estate (*Al-Tarikah*):** There must be wealth or property left behind after clearing primary obligations.

#### 2. Causes of Inheritance (Asbab al-Mirath)

* **Blood Relationship (*Nasab*):** Consanguineous relations (ascendants, descendants, and collaterals).
* **Marriage (*Nikah*):** A valid, recognized Islamic marriage existing at the exact time of death. (A spouse in the revocable waiting period, *Iddah*, of a divorce can still inherit).

#### 3. Impediments to Inheritance (Mawani' al-Mirath)

If an impediment exists, the person is treated as if they do not exist for the purposes of distribution.

* **Homicide (*Al-Qatl*):** The killer cannot inherit from the victim.
* *Shafi'i:* Absolute bar. Any type of killing (intentional, accidental, or indirect) prevents inheritance.
* *Hanafi:* Only direct, unlawful killing bars inheritance. Accidental or indirect causes may not.


* **Difference of Religion (*Ikhtilaf al-Din*):** A non-Muslim cannot inherit from a Muslim via the fixed shares (*Mirath*). However, a Muslim *can* leave up to 1/3 of their estate to a non-Muslim relative via a voluntary bequest (*Wasiyyah*).

#### 4. Priority of Estate Liquidation

The estate must be processed in this strict order before any heir receives a penny:

1. **Funeral & Burial (*Tajheez wa Takfeen*):** Reasonable, culturally appropriate expenses.
2. **Debts (*Duyun*):**
* *Religious:* Unpaid Zakat, Kaffarah, missed Hajj expenses, and unpaid *Mahr* (Dowry) owed to a wife.
* *Secular:* Mortgages, hospital bills, loans, and credit cards.


3. **Bequests (*Wasiyyah*):** Voluntary gifts limited to a maximum of **1/3** of the remaining net estate. *Crucial Rule:* A bequest cannot be made to an existing legal heir unless all other heirs consent after the testator's death.
4. **Inheritance (*Mirath*):** Distribution of the remainder to rightful heirs.

#### 5. Categories of Heirs

The remaining estate is distributed to these categories in strict order:

**A. The Quranic Sharers (*Ashab al-Furud*)**
Those whose fractional shares (1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 2/3, 1/3, 1/6) are explicitly stated in the Quran.

* *Spouses:* Husband, Wife.
* *Ascendants:* Father, Mother, True Paternal Grandfather, True Grandmother.
* *Descendants & Collaterals:* Daughter, Son's Daughter, Full Sister, Consanguineous (Paternal) Sister, Uterine (Maternal) Brother/Sister.

**B. The Residuaries (*Al-Asabat*)**
Those who take whatever is left after the *Ashab al-Furud* take their shares. If no sharers exist, they take the entire estate.

1. **Residuaries in their own right (*Asaba bi-Nafs*):** All male agnates. Ordered by proximity: Son -> Son's Son -> Father -> Paternal Grandfather -> Full Brother -> Paternal Brother -> Full Paternal Uncle -> Paternal Uncle's Son.
2. **Residuaries by another (*Asaba bi-Ghayr*):** Females who become residuaries when co-existing with their male counterparts. They split the share in a **2:1 ratio** (male gets twice the female). *Example:* Daughter(s) co-existing with Son(s); Full Sister(s) co-existing with Full Brother(s).
3. **Residuaries with another (*Asaba Ma'a al-Ghayr*):** Females who become residuaries due to the presence of other females. *Example:* Full Sisters or Paternal Sisters become residuaries and take the remainder when they co-exist with Daughters or Son's Daughters (and no brothers are present).

**C. Distant Kindred (*Dhawu al-Arham*)**
Blood relatives who are neither Sharers nor Residuaries (e.g., daughter's children, sister's children, maternal uncles/aunts). They inherit *only* if there are no Quranic Sharers (except spouses) and no Residuaries.

#### 6. The Rules of Exclusion (*Al-Hajb*)

This is the most critical mechanic in *Fara'id*.

* **Total Exclusion (*Hajb Hirman*):** When an heir is completely blocked from inheriting by the presence of a closer relative.
* *The Proximity Rule:* The nearer in degree excludes the more remote. (e.g., A Son excludes a Son's Son. A Father excludes a Paternal Grandfather).
* *The Six Un-excludable Heirs:* These six will **never** be totally excluded from an estate: Husband, Wife, Father, Mother, Son, Daughter.


* **Partial Exclusion (*Hajb Nuqsan*):** When an heir's share is reduced due to the presence of another heir.
* *Example 1:* A Husband's share drops from 1/2 to 1/4 if the deceased leaves a child.
* *Example 2:* A Mother's share drops from 1/3 to 1/6 if the deceased leaves a child OR two or more siblings.
