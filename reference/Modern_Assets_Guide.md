# Modern Assets Guide — Islamic Estate Planning

## The Critical Distinction: Probate vs. Non-Probate Assets

This is the single most important concept in modern U.S. Islamic estate planning.

**Your Islamic Will ONLY controls probate assets.**
Non-probate assets pass by operation of law or contract — entirely bypassing the will.

If you have significant non-probate assets (retirement accounts, life insurance), your carefully calculated Fara'id shares mean nothing for those assets unless you separately update each beneficiary designation.

## Non-Probate Assets — What the Will Cannot Control

### 1. Retirement Accounts: 401(k), 403(b), IRA, Roth IRA, Pension, 457(b)

**How they pass:** By beneficiary designation form on file with the plan administrator or financial institution. The will has zero effect.

**Islamic concern:** These are often the largest assets in an American Muslim's estate, yet they are completely outside the will.

**Action required:**
- Contact each plan administrator (HR department for employer plans; financial institution for IRAs)
- Complete or update a Beneficiary Designation form
- Name primary beneficiary(ies) with percentages matching your Fara'id calculation
- Name contingent (secondary) beneficiary(ies) in case a primary beneficiary predeceases you

**Advanced option — Islamic Trust as Beneficiary:**
For large retirement accounts (>$100,000), consider naming an **Islamic Revocable Living Trust** as beneficiary. The trust document can then direct distribution per Fara'id rules. Consult a Tennessee estate planning attorney experienced in trust law.

**Note on Riba (Interest):** Many Muslims have concerns about interest-bearing retirement accounts. This is a legitimate Fiqh discussion. The majority scholarly view (including many Hanafi and Shafi'i scholars in the U.S.) permits participation in employer 401(k) plans, especially where halal investment options are unavailable, due to necessity (*Darura*). Consult your Imam or a qualified Islamic finance scholar for your specific situation.

### 2. Life Insurance Policies

**How they pass:** By beneficiary designation on file with the insurance company.

**Islamic concern:**
- Traditional life insurance (*Ta'min*) involves elements of uncertainty (*Gharar*) and interest (*Riba*) that many scholars consider prohibited
- **Takaful** (Islamic cooperative insurance) is the Shariah-compliant alternative
- However, if a Muslim holds a conventional life insurance policy, the *death benefit* going to the family is generally considered permissible by many U.S. scholars because it involves compensation for loss, not gambling

**Action required:**
- Contact each insurance company
- Update the beneficiary designation form
- Name primary and contingent beneficiaries with Fara'id-compliant percentages

**Takaful in Tennessee:** Takaful providers are expanding in the U.S. If switching to Takaful, ensure the new policy is in force before canceling existing coverage.

### 3. Joint Tenancy Real Estate ("With Right of Survivorship")

**How it passes:** When one joint tenant dies, their share **automatically** transfers to the surviving joint tenant(s) by operation of law — regardless of what the will says.

**Example:** If you own your home jointly with your spouse as "Joint Tenants with Right of Survivorship," your spouse receives 100% of the home automatically. Your children, parents, and other heirs receive nothing from that property, even if your will specifies otherwise.

**Islamic concern:** This completely bypasses Fara'id for the family home, which is often the largest asset.

**Solutions:**
1. **Re-title as Tenants in Common:** Allows each owner's share to pass through their will per Fara'id. Requires a new deed. Consult a Tennessee real estate attorney.
2. **Leave as-is and account for it:** If the spouse is entitled to that property anyway under Islamic rules, joint tenancy may be acceptable in that specific case. Analyze against the Fara'id calculation.
3. **Islamic Revocable Living Trust:** Transfer the property into a trust that distributes per Fara'id upon death.

**Tenants in Common vs. Joint Tenancy:**
- **Tenants in Common:** Each owner has a distinct, divisible share that passes through their will or intestacy. *Recommended for Shariah compliance.*
- **Joint Tenants with Right of Survivorship:** Surviving owner gets everything automatically. *May conflict with Fara'id.*

Check your property deed — look for the words "right of survivorship" or "JTWROS." If present, discuss re-titling with an attorney.

### 4. Payable-on-Death (POD) Bank Accounts

**How they pass:** Funds transfer directly to the named beneficiary upon death, bypassing probate.

**Action required:** Visit each bank and update POD designations to match Fara'id shares.

---

### 5. Transfer-on-Death (TOD) Investment Accounts & Vehicles

**How they pass:** Same as POD — directly to named beneficiary.

In Tennessee, vehicles can have a TOD designation on the title. Investment brokerage accounts frequently have TOD designations.

**Action required:** Update TOD designations on all investment accounts and any vehicles with TOD titles.

---

### 6. Employer-Sponsored Benefits

**Group Life Insurance:** Separate from personal life insurance. Usually 1–2x annual salary. Update beneficiary through HR.

**Pension / Defined Benefit Plans:** Contact HR for beneficiary designation form. Some pensions have survivor benefit elections that must be made at retirement — plan ahead.

**Deferred Compensation (457(b), SERP):** Update beneficiary designation separately.

## Digital Assets — An Emerging Category

### What Are Digital Assets?
- **Financial:** Cryptocurrency (Bitcoin, Ethereum), NFTs, digital wallets (Coinbase, MetaMask, Ledger)
- **Social/Personal:** Email accounts, social media profiles, cloud storage (Google Drive, iCloud, Dropbox)
- **Business:** Domain names, websites, online stores (Etsy, eBay, Amazon Seller accounts)
- **Subscriptions/Intellectual Property:** Ebooks, stock photos, software licenses with transferable value

### Cryptocurrency — Special Considerations

**Islamic Ruling on Crypto:** A widely debated area. Many contemporary Hanafi and Shafi'i scholars consider Bitcoin and major cryptocurrencies permissible as a medium of exchange and store of value, citing that they have real-world utility and market value. Others express concerns about speculation (*Maysir*). Consult a qualified Islamic finance scholar for your specific holdings.

**Estate Planning Mechanics:**
- Crypto does NOT automatically transfer — it is only accessible via **private keys** or **seed phrases**
- If private keys are lost at death, the crypto is permanently inaccessible
- Do NOT include private keys in the will itself (wills become public records at probate)

**Recommended approach:**
1. Write down the wallet addresses, seed phrases, and instructions
2. Store in a **sealed envelope** marked "Digital Asset Access Instructions — Open Upon My Death"
3. Store the envelope in a fireproof safe or give it to your attorney in a sealed client file
4. Reference the envelope in the will: *"My Executor will find instructions for accessing my digital assets in [LOCATION]"*
5. Include the monetary value of crypto in the overall estate calculation for Fara'id purposes

### Social Media Accounts
- **Facebook/Meta:** Has a "Legacy Contact" feature — designate someone to memorialize the account
- **Google:** Has "Inactive Account Manager" — set this up in your Google account settings
- **Instagram:** Does not have a formal legacy feature; a family member must request memorialization
- **LinkedIn:** Family members can request account closure

Include a clause in the will directing your Executor to close, memorialize, or transfer social media accounts per your wishes.

## Tennessee-Specific Asset Considerations

### Tennessee Homestead Exemption (T.C.A. § 30-2-201)
A surviving spouse is entitled to the homestead regardless of the will, up to certain limits. This is another reason the **Elective Share Waiver** must include a waiver of homestead rights to ensure full Islamic compliance.

### Tennessee Intestacy (If There Is No Will — T.C.A. § 31-2-104)
Without a will, Tennessee distributes assets by intestacy law, which significantly differs from Fara'id:
- Spouse receives the entire estate if no children
- Spouse and children share equally (each gets equal portions)
- No recognition of the 2:1 male:female ratio
- Religious debts (Mahr, Zakat, Kaffarah) are not prioritized

**This is why having an Islamic Will is obligatory — intestacy completely violates Fara'id.**

---

## Recommended Additional Documents (Beyond the Will)

| Document | Purpose | Priority |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **Waiver of Elective Share** | Prevents spouse from claiming 10–40% of estate | Essential if married |
| **Durable Power of Attorney** | Designates someone to manage finances if incapacitated (pre-death) | Highly recommended |
| **Healthcare Power of Attorney** | Designates someone to make medical decisions if incapacitated | Highly recommended |
| **Living Will / Advance Directive** | States your wishes on life support and end-of-life care (in accordance with Islamic ethics on preserving life) | Recommended |
| **Revocable Living Trust** | Avoids probate entirely; enables Fara'id distribution of trust assets including retirement accounts | Consider for estates >$150k or complex family situations |
| **HIPAA Authorization** | Allows your designated agent to access medical records | Helpful |
